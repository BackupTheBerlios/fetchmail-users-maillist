Just to clarify: a hash is not a short-term solution. I don't think
we'll see this in 6.3.X beyond what's already there.

Thanks for providing that information. The actual problem is p3scan's
attempt to scan in real-time, which failed miserably. The proper
solution would be to change the setup:

1. fetchmail downloads the message

2. fetchmail injects either into an MTA which has a after-queueing scanner hooked up
   (for instance Postfix with amavisd-new)

3. the MTA queues the message with a &quot;must inspect content&quot;.

4. MTA hands the message to the scanner, which can take as long as it
   desires, and then takes action depending on the result. Either
   defang, pass on, bounce, or erase.

5. MTA then hands the message to the local delivery agent (internal,
   maildrop, procmail, deliver, ...) which stuffs the mail into a
   mailbox

6. a local POP3 or IMAP server offers access to the content-scanned
   message to the client.

Step 3 and 4 are important - this makes for fast acceptance to prevent
timeouts and allows the scanner to take all the time it needs, without
respect to network timeouts.
