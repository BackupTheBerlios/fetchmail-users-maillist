&gt;<i> I think, the current code which is assuming that mails have been
</I>&gt;<i> expunged only on a successful quit is ok. It is a straighforward code
</I>&gt;<i> which is not hard to understand. Setting UID_EXPUNGED before sending
</I>&gt;<i> QUIT is probably going to make the code harder to debug, especially in
</I>&gt;<i> the edge cases. Another case I can think of is:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> POP3&gt; QUIT
</I>&gt;<i> POP3&lt; -ERR Disk full
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What is probably required is to directly delete the mails which have
</I>&gt;<i> been deleted (UID_DELETED), but not yet expunged.
</I>
That's what we're trying to achieve. OK, we might hold off EXPUNGE and
look at the return code from the &quot;QUIT&quot; request. I don't have time right
now, but I'll look into this later, to figure out which errors can
happen and what to do with them.

&gt;&gt;<i> Can you elaborate how to handle this separately?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I mean, your patch is doing three things:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - Adding comments to the code, fixing other minor issues
</I>&gt;<i> - Adding the UID_PENDDELE flag
</I>&gt;<i> - Saving and restoring the DELETED flag in .fetchids
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The above issues are equally important. But they are separate issues
</I>&gt;<i> and should be addressed separately. I am saying this only to keep the
</I>&gt;<i> size of the patch under discussion small.
</I>
Fine. I'll break them out later into a series of patches. I don't think
they can be independent of each other though, but they will have to be
applied in order.

&gt;&gt;<i> BTW, we need the &quot;DELETED&quot; flagging in .fetchids to make your
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;UID_UNSEEN&quot; patch (re-fetch rather than mark seen) anyways. 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Else everything becomes &quot;SEEN vs. UNSEEN&quot; next time fetchmail is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (re-)started anyways.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Handling it in .fetchids requires more thought. Just adding the
</I>&gt;<i> DELETED word is not enough. Atleast, an expiration time will have to
</I>&gt;<i> be added to the DELETED flag.
</I>
I don't think so, and if the end user's system has a goofed up system
time, it won't help either.

&gt;<i> What if a person runs fetchmail after a week or more? In this case, it
</I>&gt;<i> is probably unsafe to assume that it is the same old mail which should
</I>&gt;<i> be deleted directly.
</I>
So we're essentially heading to a flag &quot;assume fetchmail is the only one
accessing said mailbox? yes/no&quot;. Not only in this context such a flag
would be useful. I'd rather not contemplate the havoc this flag wreaks
if set to &quot;true&quot; when that isn't true. That scares me away from putting
something like this on my agenda^WTODO.

&gt;<i> Another potential problem: what if the user is running the second
</I>&gt;<i> instance of fetchmail with 'keep'? I think, your patch will still
</I>&gt;<i> delete the mail directly (not checked).
</I>
I think it would.
