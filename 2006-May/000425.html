<PRE>Quoting from Matthias Andree's mail on Wed, May 24, 2006:
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, it will. But how can we reliably tell &quot;server received QUIT&quot; from
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;server did not receive QUIT&quot;? Do we get OS errors because the TCP
</I>&gt;<i> ACK-flagged packets didn't come back, or because we got some ICMP or
</I>&gt;<i> RST? Was the crucial ICMP perhaps dropped by the usual asinine firewalls
</I>&gt;<i> that block all inbound ICMP? What kernel and version uses which codes to
</I>&gt;<i> report issues? We might perhaps try &quot;STAT&quot; before resetting the flags so
</I>&gt;<i> as to check if the connection was broken at the time we reach the logout
</I>&gt;<i> code, but how else can we handle this?
</I>
I think, the current code which is assuming that mails have been
expunged only on a successful quit is ok. It is a straighforward code
which is not hard to understand. Setting UID_EXPUNGED before sending
QUIT is probably going to make the code harder to debug, especially in
the edge cases. Another case I can think of is:

POP3&gt; QUIT
POP3&lt; -ERR Disk full

What is probably required is to directly delete the mails which have
been deleted (UID_DELETED), but not yet expunged.

&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; In that case, fetchmail would then safely retry the deletion.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Undoubtedly, saving the flag is required. However, to keep things
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; simpler, it would have been better if this issue was fixed separately.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Can you elaborate how to handle this separately?
</I>
I mean, your patch is doing three things:

- Adding comments to the code, fixing other minor issues
- Adding the UID_PENDDELE flag
- Saving and restoring the DELETED flag in .fetchids

The above issues are equally important. But they are separate issues
and should be addressed separately. I am saying this only to keep the
size of the patch under discussion small.

&gt;<i> BTW, we need the &quot;DELETED&quot; flagging in .fetchids to make your
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;UID_UNSEEN&quot; patch (re-fetch rather than mark seen) anyways. 
</I>&gt;<i> Else everything becomes &quot;SEEN vs. UNSEEN&quot; next time fetchmail is
</I>&gt;<i> (re-)started anyways.
</I>
Handling it in .fetchids requires more thought. Just adding the
DELETED word is not enough. Atleast, an expiration time will have to
be added to the DELETED flag. What if a person runs fetchmail after a
week or more? In this case, it is probably unsafe to assume that it is
the same old mail which should be deleted directly.

Another potential problem: what if the user is running the second
instance of fetchmail with 'keep'? I think, your patch will still
delete the mail directly (not checked).
