That was a problem with Fedora, when I first started using it - I didn't 
realise each version is only supported for basically a year.  The legacy 
project is next to useless.  However, I'm in the process of upgrading 
from FC3, to 4 then to 5 (the oldest supported version).

Ok, that's good to know.

That's basically what I'm after.  I sent a similar message to the 
Getmail list also.

&gt;&gt;<i> And for ease of administration, I run Fetchmail as root, collecting

</I>
I really don't know how to do this, it's in the documentation I presume? 
  Even if I gave it it's own user/group, could I still continue running 
it as a daemon collecting and delivering mail for all users from a 
single instance and rc file?

Many thanks,
Steve :)
