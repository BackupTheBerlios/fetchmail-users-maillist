Yeah, I've become a fan of Gentoo as it doesn't suffer from that
problem (so you can install 2005.0, apply the updates and you get the
same as if you'd started from 2006.1).

&gt;<i> I really don't know how to do this, it's in the documentation I presume?
</I>
Not really, there's nothing in the documentation about running it a
root either though :)  Basically, just start it as a non-root user.

&gt;<i>   Even if I gave it it's own user/group, could I still continue running
</I>&gt;<i> it as a daemon collecting and delivering mail for all users from a
</I>&gt;<i> single instance and rc file?
</I>
Yup.  That's pretty much how I handle it (well, I use one daemon per
ISP to avoid problems with one delaying polls for the others).

Basically, the only time you need a program running as root is if it
needs to listen on a port below 1024, access certain files or
otherwise bypass all security checks.  Fetchmail doesn't do any of
that so it doesn't need to be run as root.  And, as I said, the
developer has already said he'll be disabling the ability to run it as
root in the near future as it's a large security risk.
