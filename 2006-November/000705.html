<PRE>(sorry everybody for the very late answer, comments below)

The problem was that I *could* talk to a dovecot server via webmail
but not with fetchmail. no matter which options I passed to it, it
always failed as &quot;unknown user or wrong password), even if the
password and user name used by procmail were the SAME I used via
webmail.

(me blushing...) because I was sure, in that moment, mutt couldn't do
it.  Please don't ask why I thought so, let's just say I wasn't
sleeping well in those weeks...

Anyway: after a few trials with mutt, which worked just fine, I had an
inspiration (for lack of a better word): I opened fetchmailrc,
canceled ALL the fetchmail &quot;recipe&quot; for downloading the messages and
rewrote it from scratch, just as it was before. After that, believe it
or not, everything worked.

The only way I can explain this is that some weird, non printing
character got mixed in the password and /or username strings someway.

I hope this helps others to avoid the same waste of time I had :-(

Ciao and thanks for your support,
