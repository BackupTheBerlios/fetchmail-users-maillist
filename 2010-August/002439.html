&gt;<i> How do other mail applications (like Thunderbird or Outlook) store

</I>Some email clients have the option to store encrypted passwords, but its 
no more difficult to acquire a copy of the encrypted file and then 
decrypted it. And if POP email is being used the passwords are sent in 
plain text making them available to anyone sniffing the network.

There will probably be plenty of encryption crackers available to 
decrypt Thunderbird and Outlook passwords. How do you think sysadmins 
recover users Inboxes?
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Secondly, I don't see why having a key (to decrypted passwords) isn't

</I>It is slightly more secure but it can encourage complacency.
&gt;<i> They would need physical access to my USB drive.
</I>They already have such access (eg; a work colleague, friend, relative 
[ie; directly or indirectly]).
&gt;<i> Plug it in, download mail, unplug it.
</I>A remote attacker could copy the file/s or even acquire an image of the 
whole USB drive whilst you have it plugged in.
&gt;<i> The opportunity of attack is much smaller; were as passwords sitting 
</I>&gt;<i> in plain text are much easier to find.
</I>No the opportunity is only very slightly smaller.

Unless you're running fetchmail continuously, then why isn't the 
.fetchmailrc file on your USB drive as well?
If you're running fetchmail 24/7 and an MTA to forward email to one or 
more clients then this would be better done on a separate dedicated machine.

If you require secure email then you need to purchase a specialized 
secure email system or create your own. However unless your sending and 
receiving government secrets, highly sensitive commercial secrets, 
sharing terrorist information or other illicit material then why on 
earth would you want such paranoid email security.

It all boils down to the application of some relevant common sense.

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> What's the best way to tighten this up a bit?
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> At work we have a in house application that stores passwords in an 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> encrypted
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> database.  The way you put passwords in scripts is you use a key 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> file to
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;PasswordVault -username test -getpassword -key /mykey.txt&quot; which 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> returns
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> plain text password.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Not much more secure; but would help from a `cat ~/.fetchmailrc` 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;attack&quot;.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Anything like that in fetchmail or third party?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> No, because it buys you no meaningful security.  Anybody who could
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> have otherwise got access to your password by reading the file can run
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the tool and get the password.  You've bought yourself nothing.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> To stop the &quot;attack&quot; you mention, ensure only the owner can read the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> file (fetchmail will refuse to run if this isn't the case).  If you
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> don't trust the root user then you have bigger issues.
