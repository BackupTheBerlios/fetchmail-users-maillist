This is wrong, misinformation, and a disservice to the users on the list,  
it wastes my time, and so this is also a disservice to the fetchmail  
development process. It is also against the universal etiquette of mailing  
lists.

The proper answer is in  
<A HREF="002450.html">http://lists.berlios.de/pipermail/fetchmail-users/2010-August/002450.html</A>  
- summarized, it's not possible with IMAP. Michelle should have read that  
before replying to the thread. Evidently she didn't, so I have to post  
this information again to get the archives right. This is such a horrible  
waste of time for everyone.


Rob, please configure the list so that Michelle Konzack and and the whole  
Tamay Dogan network can no longer post to the list.
They're free to read, because that does not waste my time or the time of  
users in need of assistance.

I know that mistakes to happen, and include myself here, but I am finally  
really fed up with this continual stream of misinformation from Michelle.   
Michelle had been warned several times over the past years.

I cannot tolerate misinformation, because that would subvert the whole  
purpose of the list.  However, I have little time on my hands, and I need  
to use it efficiently.  Thus I seek to have the biggest time drain on this  
list plugged, so that I can continue support via the list.

Sorry for that, but I see no other recourse.  I am ready to discuss this,  
and alternatives, OFF-LIST, but not before September 1st.
