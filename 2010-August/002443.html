I feel like I'm in an alternative universe.  Not sure why people are so 
passionate about defending plain text passwords.

Ok, let's go over this and tell me were I'm misinformed:

If someone compromises my user account; the effort to read my passwords 
from a .fetchmailrc/.getmailrc file is very small.  Takes no effort at all.
I think we agree there.  The probability of them compromising my account 
in it's self I think is very low.  But let's assume they do and don't 
have root access yet.

If my passwords are in a pwsafe safe on a encrypted volume that is only 
physically present in the system for ~30 seconds then they'll have to 
obtain my passwords for both the encrypted volume and pwsafe.  Ok, they 
can install a keylogger - hardware or software, which take more effort 
then reading a plain text file.  They'll then have to get a copy of my 
pwsafe off an encrypted volume and then grab my key from another usb 
drive.  Ok, that is plausible; but think it takes a bit more effort and 
some planning.

Or, they could dump the memory from fetch mail and sort though it and 
find it that way.  Ok, wait, well, it runs as a different user, so 
they'll have to comprise that account too or gain elevated privileges.
But I mean sure, that's also possible.  Seems to me though, that 
requires a bit more difficult than just reading a plain text file that 
they already have permission to access.

I'm not saying this is 100% bullet proof.  I'm saying it'll take them 
more effort and slow them down compared to just reading it.

Maybe I'm wrong.  What part of the above setup is as weak as or weaker 
as storing it in plain text?
