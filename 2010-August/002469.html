Yes indeed.  Browsers haven't always been as good as deterring users from  
overriding trust warnings though as they are today.  I recall times where  
getting Firefox or Opera to connect to <A HREF="https://">https://</A> sites insecurely was as  
quick as a simple mouse click/keypress on one of the numerous  
indistinguishable matter-of-fact requesters.

Opera has become picky as of version 9.64, and it was - by comparison to  
its contemporaries - unrelenting. If the certificate chain wasn't  
completely presented by the server, it was next to impossible for the  
average user to connect, and I've had to educate not just one tech support  
teams to explain how they needed to install the intermediate CA  
certificates if their server certificates were issued by some hierarchical  
CA trust scheme as is popular in research networks.  I figured that the  
documentation for certificate management was rather limited and often did  
not tell admins to install the whole chain, hence README.SSL-SERVER in the  
distribution.

Firefox has also caught up, although I don't know which version of Firefox  
was first.  Tell the OpenSSH team they should use texts that are more  
scary in interactive mode. GnuPG is a bit better in asking such questions  
on the command line as you would like to have in SSH, though it's probably  
still not going all the long way that recent Firefox has gone to make  
click-through-to-no-security really long-winded and inconvenient (and I  
think convenience is the main purpose here).


I plan to make fetchmail much pickier in a future version (that will not  
be called 6.3.something), and make sslcertck the default and clean up and  
the SSL options so they become clearer, and also give hints when something  
is insecure.  The principle should be that it's secure by default and  
people need to relax security explicitly, rather than the other way around  
as it's now.  I know I'm taking chances because it might make getting  
things up and running sufficiently difficult that some users will run away  
and use other software, and I might also overlook something up front which  
will become a best current practice later on.

Still I think it's worth it.

Best regards
