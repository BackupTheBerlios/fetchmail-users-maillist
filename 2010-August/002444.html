At least, when you see the plain text password sitting in your configuration 
file, you know for sure you have to protect that file and make sure nobody 
gets its hands on it (and that's exactly what you do by using 
truecrypt :-) ).

If you believe your password is safe in the file, then you may not care 
enough...

Encrypting the password will only prevent a user from reading it with a 
simple &quot;cat fetchmailrc&quot; while you walk away from your terminal. Any really 
dangerous user will know how to copy that file somewhere else where he will 
have the leisure to decrypt it with the right tools. You *must* protect that 
file against any illegitimate read access.

You gain nothing by encrypting the password except a false sense of 
confidence. But you may eventually loose the opportunity to double check the 
password or simply read it yourself because you forgot what it was and where 
the original clear text password had been stored a few years ago.
