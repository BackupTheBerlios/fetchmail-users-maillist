For this purpose I use  &quot;Mailfollowup-To:&quot;  which  let  peoples  respond
privately IF NECCESARY.  Munging of  &quot;Reply-To:&quot;  prevent  it,  since  a
person WHO want to answer privately need to EDIT the message by Hand...

And what is WRONG with my request?

I post on the LIST and want the answer on THE LIST. I have  no  need  to
get all messages zwice, exspecialy If am on expensive GSM

Are you braindamaged?  I am using Mailinglists since OVER 15  years  and
never had to remove someone from the header.  I respond ALWAYS  to  list
if Cc: is NOT REQUESTED.

Please use a suitable MUA since we are NOT on a Winsuck mailinglist.

&gt;<i> option that uses the From header anyway even if there is a Reply-to 
</I>&gt;<i> header.  This option was created specifically to be able to send private 
</I>&gt;<i> replies to bad mailing lists that munged the reply-to header, but should 
</I>&gt;<i> work equally well for this use.
</I>
He?  What are you talking about?

Only BROKEN MUA can not send messages to lists.

&gt;<i> &gt; And of course, this is a mailinglist and ANY replys should go  there and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Cc:  only  IF  requested.  And  last  not  least,  THIS  mailinglist  IS
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; SUBSCRIBER ONLY which mean, ALL  POSTERS  are  subscribed  and  get  the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; response from the LIST.  There is absolutly no reason to bother  Posters
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; with CCing them.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   
</I>&gt;<i> Should according to you maybe, but not according to both standards and 
</I>&gt;<i> practice, which defines the MUA's reply-to-all function as replying to 
</I>
YOUR STANDARD and YOUR PRACTICE.

We are NOT on a windows mailinglists and schould use suitable and RECENT
MUAs which handel lists correctly.

&gt;<i> all addresses listed in To, Cc, and Reply-to ( or From if absent ) 
</I>&gt;<i> headers.  Unfortunately there is no standard way to get the workflow you 
</I>&gt;<i> want other than placing undue burden on the user by asking them to 
</I>&gt;<i> manually modify the addresses in their replies.
</I>
What about using &lt;List-Reply&gt;?  This is, whta I use since 15  years.  It
works perfectly, but since you are using Windows, I can not  asume,  you
understand  this  problem.  It  is  always   the   same   problem   with
Windows-User.  DO NOT TRY TO FORCE ME TO USE YOUR WINDOWS CRAP!!!!!!!!!!
