</I>Munging means the mailing list throws it out and replaces it.  This 
header is SUPPOSED to be set by YOU, the sender, to indicate that you 
want replies to go somewhere other than the From address.  By asking 
people not to Cc you, you are asking them to manually remove your 
address in the reply anyhow.  Since replying to all is the far more 
common thing to do on with a message posted to a mailing list, there 
would be less burden on your recipients if they only have to modify 
their headers in the rare case that they wish for a private reply, and 
indeed, there are some MUAs out there that offer a third type of reply 
option that uses the From header anyway even if there is a Reply-to 
header.  This option was created specifically to be able to send private 
replies to bad mailing lists that munged the reply-to header, but should 
work equally well for this use.

&gt;<i> And of course, this is a mailinglist and ANY replys should go  there and
</I>&gt;<i> Cc:  only  IF  requested.  And  last  not  least,  THIS  mailinglist  IS
</I>&gt;<i> SUBSCRIBER ONLY which mean, ALL  POSTERS  are  subscribed  and  get  the
</I>&gt;<i> response from the LIST.  There is absolutly no reason to bother  Posters
</I>&gt;<i> with CCing them.
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>Should according to you maybe, but not according to both standards and 
practice, which defines the MUA's reply-to-all function as replying to 
all addresses listed in To, Cc, and Reply-to ( or From if absent ) 
headers.  Unfortunately there is no standard way to get the workflow you 
want other than placing undue burden on the user by asking them to 
manually modify the addresses in their replies.
