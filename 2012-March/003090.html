gmail doesn't actually delete messages, they are moved to the archive out
of sight.

Yes, fetchmail doesn't do &quot;synchronization&quot;.

Which means that if you use Thunderbird to read emails with the laptop
directly from gmail, and then download them via fetchmail from the desktop
- - - yes, they download because they are still in the inbox, not in the
archive - those emails you read already will appear as new in your local inbox.

That's a feature fetchmail doesn't have but that I would like. There is
another tool that I haven't used that can do imap syncing in both
directions. I don't remember the name.

Reading in the gmail web may be different. The trick to be careful about is
that email must remain in the inbox so that fetchmail sees them later.
