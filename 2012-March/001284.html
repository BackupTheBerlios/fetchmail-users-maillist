<PRE>if ((ok = gen_recv(sock, buf, sizeof(buf))))
    return(ok);
} while
(!strstr(buf+4, &quot;FETCH&quot;) || sscanf(buf+2, &quot;%d&quot;, &amp;num) != 1);

It appears to be looking for a &quot;FETCH&quot; in the response, but since it
never finds one it blocks on recv() waiting.  After 300 seconds
timeout_handled() is called (stage == SERVER_WAIT), which then jumps
to cleanUp and reports a PS_SOCKET error.

** Conjecture on how to solve the problem:
The choices for fixing this seem to be:
   1) Have fetchmail parse the headers, but only buffer the result
instead of delivering it until we know there is a message body.

   2) Create special-case code that would work with procmail to kill
procmail if we realize no body exists (if you send SIGQUIT to procmail
while it's reading, it will silently discard).  This keeps from having
to change the header buffering model.

   3) Add code to re-try message body fetches that return &quot;NO&quot;.

   4) Do nothing and let MDA's deal with the problem.

#1 seems like it would be a pretty invasive change, even if made
optional.  #2 is special-purpose hackery, but I'm not sure how other
delivery agents handle this case.  Perhaps procmail is the only agent
that has this behavior (not sure?), so special-case code wouldn't be
so terrible.  #3 seems like the best case, but I'm not familiar enough
with fetchmail to suggest a patch just yet.  #4 works too, but I'd say
it's less &quot;proper&quot;, because fetchmail is failing to fetch mail.
Surely the server is mostly to blame, but with all the workaround and
retry behavior built into fetchmail, it seems this case deserves a
workaround too.

Regardless of the body vs. header issue, it seems that
imap_fetch_body()'s is failing to comply with RFC2060 section 7.1.2
regarding the handling of &quot;NO&quot; error responses, based on my
interpretation.


** Workaround for procmail users:
Add the following to the top of your .procmailrc, which sends messages
with a body less than 3 bytes to /dev/null.

----- cut here -----
:<i>0
</I>* B ?? &lt; 3
/dev/null
----- cut here -----


** Final words:
I have a workaround.  I'm sending this bug report for the benefit of
fetchmail maintainers / users in case others run into this problem.  I
may submit a patch to fetchmail at a later date, if you agree a patch
is required (please advise).

Thanks!
