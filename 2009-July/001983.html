<PRE>Greetings,

I am announcing the release of fetchmail 6.3.10.
This new stable version of fetchmail fixes some bugs, updates
documentation, and makes various other changes, see below for details.

The software is available from:
&lt;<A HREF="http://developer.berlios.de/project/showfiles.php?group_id=1824">http://developer.berlios.de/project/showfiles.php?group_id=1824</A>&gt;

The fetchmail home pages are:
&lt;<A HREF="http://www.fetchmail.info/">http://www.fetchmail.info/</A>&gt;  or  &lt;<A HREF="http://fetchmail.berlios.de/">http://fetchmail.berlios.de/</A>&gt;

These are the relevant changes in 6.3.10 since 6.3.9;
unless otherwise noted, changes to this release were made by Matthias Andree:

# ADVANCE WARNING OF FEATURES TO BE REMOVED OR CHANGED IN FUTURE VERSIONS
(There are no plans to remove features from a 6.3.X release, but they may be
removed from a 6.4.0 or newer release.)
* The MX and host alias DNS lookups that fetchmail performs in multidrop mode
  are based on assumptions that are rarely met in practice, somewhat defective,
  deprecated and may be removed from a future fetchmail version.
  They have never supported IPv6 (including IPv6-mapped IPv4).
  Non-DNS based alias keywords such as &quot;aka&quot; will remain in fetchmail.
* The monitor and interface options may be removed from a future fetchmail
  version as they are not reasonably portable across operating systems.
* POP2 is obsolete, support will be removed from a future fetchmail version.
* RPOP is obsolete, support will be removed from a future fetchmail release.
* --sslcertck will become a default setting in a future fetchmail version.
* The multidrop To/Cc guessing code along with the fragile duplicate suppressor
  is deprecated and may be removed from a future release.
* The &quot;envelope Received&quot; option may be removed from a future release, because
  the Received header was never meant to be machine-readable, the format varies
  widely, and various other differences in behavior make parsing Received an
  unreliable undertaking. The envelope option as such will remain though, in
  order to support Delivered-To, X-Envelope-To, X-Original-To and similar.
  See also &lt;<A HREF="http://home.pages.de/~mandree/mail/multidrop">http://home.pages.de/~mandree/mail/multidrop</A>&gt;.
* The --enable-fallback (fall back to MDA if MTA unavailable) will be removed
  from a future fetchmail release, because it makes fetchmail's behavior
  inconsistent and confusing.
* The &quot;protocol auto&quot; default inside fetchmail may be removed from a future
  fetchmail release. Explicit configuration of the protocol is recommended.
* Kerberos IV support may be removed from a future fetchmail release.
* SIGHUP wakeup support may be removed from a future fetchmail release and
  cause fetchmail to terminate - it was broken for many years.
* Support for operating systems that are not sufficiently POSIX compliant may be
  removed or operation on such systems may be suboptimal for future releases.
  This means that fetchmail may only continue to work on C99 and POSIX 2001
  based systems.
* The maintainer may migrate fetchmail to C++ with STL or C#, and impose further
  requirements (dependencies), such as Boost or other class libraries.
* The softbounce option default will change to &quot;false&quot; in the next release.

# INCOMPATIBLE BUGFIXES AND CHANGES
* Fetchmail no longer drops permanently undelivered messages by default, to
  match historic documentation.  It does this by adding a new &quot;softbounce&quot;
  option, see below.
  Fixes Debian Bug#471283, demotes Debian Bug#494418 to wishlist.
* There is a new &quot;softbounce&quot; global option that prevents the deletion of
  messages that have not been forwarded. It defaults to &quot;true&quot; for fetchmail
  6.3.X in order to match historic documentation. This may change its default
  in the next major release.

# BUGFIXES
* Fix misuse of canonical autoconf target as _TARGET when it should have been
  _HOST. Report and patch courtesy of Diego E. &quot;Flameeyes&quot; Petten&#242;.
  Details: <A HREF="http://blog.flameeyes.eu/2009/01/01/the-canonical-target">http://blog.flameeyes.eu/2009/01/01/the-canonical-target</A>
* Do not lose PS_MAXFETCH (13) exit status when hitting maxpoll. Reported by
  Michelle Konzack, Debian Bug#508667.
* Do not overlap source and destination fields in snprintf() in interface.c.
  Courtesy of Nico Golde, Debian.
* When a pre- or post-connect command fails, now report the exit status or
  termination signal properly through sys/wait.h macros.
* When acquiring a body, understand NIL (&quot;no such data item&quot;), as returned by
  some MS Exchange versions. Fixes BerliOS Bug #11980 by KB Sriram.
* Make progress tickers (-v/--showdots) consistent, and update documentation 
  accordingly (&quot;.&quot; for each 1024 octets read, &quot;#&quot; for a header written, and &quot;*&quot; 
  for each body line written.)
  The conditions under which these had been printed were inconsistent,
  illogical, and documentation hadn't matched real behaviour for long.
* For NTLM authentication, use dynamically allocated buffers.
  Fixes Debian Bug#449179, reported by Stepan Golosunov.
* Non-delivery notice (&quot;bounce mail&quot;) now mentions the original reason again,
  before the address list. This fixes a regression introduced in 6.3.0.
* Several compiler warnings were fixed.
* The minimum recommended SMTP (RFC-5321) timeouts are enforced to leave
  sufficient time for the listener to respond. Some synchronous listeners,
  particularly when used with spam filtering and other policy enforcement
  services, take extended amounts of time to process messages after the sender,
  recipient, or data block and EOM line. This can cause fetchmail to not wait
  long enough for the &quot;250 Ok&quot; and make fetchmail believe the message wasn't
  properly delivered when in fact it was; fetchmail would then retry the
  download next time and never make progress.
  Fixes Berlios Bug #10972, reported by Viktor Binzberger.
* The ESMTP/LMTP client will now apply an application-specific timeout while
  waiting for the EHLO/LHLO response, rather than wait for the server or TCP
  connection timeout.
* Treat 530 errors as temporary, so as not to delete messages on configuration
  errors. Partially taken from Petr Cerny's patch in Novell Bugzilla #246829.
  The 501 part of said patch was not added, as the maintainer is not convinced
  501 is a temporary condition, and softbounce takes care of this anyways.

# CHANGES
* Make the comparison of the SSL fingerprints case insensitive, to
  ease its use. Suggested by Daniel Richard G.
* Proper precedence ordering for the syslog and logfile options. If the logfile
  option is effective (i. e. we're not in daemon mode and nodetach isn't used),
  reset the syslog option. If logfile is ineffective (we're not in daemon mode,
  or nodetach is set), syslog takes precedence.
* The sleeping at/awakened at messages appear in logfiles and syslog only if
  verbose mode is enabled.  On the console, they will still appear without
  verbose mode.  Fixes Debian Bug#282259.
* fetchmail only requests IPv6 addresses via name service if at least one is
  configured on the local host, likewise for IPv4.  (AI_ADDRCONFIG flag to
  getaddrinfo()) Extended version of Redhat's patch.
* If the server name contains &quot;yahoo.com&quot;, offers the &quot;ID&quot; capability, and we're
  polling via IMAP, send an ID (&quot;guid&quot; &quot;1&quot;) transaction first, ignoring its
  result. This appears needed to be able to log into Yahoo's Zimbra servers, but
  there are open issues (such as being only able to download one message and
  server certificate mismatches).

# CHANGES TO CONTRIB
* Fix bashism in contrib/fetchsetup. Fixes Debian Bug#530081.

# DOCUMENTATION
* Some parts of the the manual page were revised for clarity, accuracy, and
  updated recommendations (particularly SSL/TLS) and formatting conventions from
  man-pages(7).
* The README and README.SSL documents were updated.
* A document, README.SSL-SERVER, was added to describe server-side requirements
  for proper SSL and/or TLS service offerings. These are not specific to
  fetchmail.
* Documentation on how to make &quot;NOMAIL&quot; (exit code 1) not treated an error has
  been added to the EXIT CODES section of the manpage and to the FAQ as item C8.
  The suggested solution uses a tiny POSIX shell script fragment.
  Fixes Debian Bug #530749, filed by Reuben Thomas.

* [cs]    Czech (Petr Pisar)
* [en_GB] English/British
