<PRE>Once more, with feeling - keep the traffic on the list so that others
can benefit from this in the future and provide assistance.  I'm not
here to personally support you...

Which version, what kernel?  If you're having to ask then you need the
help of somebody who really knows what they're doing, and has access
to your systems.  You/they will need to look at the various reported
stats and errors from netstat.  A quick indicator would be from:

    netstat -s | egrep -i &quot;retrans|error&quot;

A high number of errors or retransmissions (particularly if they keep
growing rapidly) indicate probable network problems.

Keep in mind that there are 2 parties in all of this - it may well be
that the real problem is at the other end, over which you have no
control.

&gt;<i> There is a constant ping on the line between 650-1500 MS when I ping google and on the adsl it is 40 ms all the time !?!
</I>
Ping stats aren't a good measure of anything beyond, at best, latency.
 The difference is because with the satellite link you're travelling a
*lot* further (about 45,000 miles from ground to satellite and back -
almost twice the circumference of the earth).

&gt;<i> They also told me another error they had from the windows system.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Why do the fetchmail not silently reconnect like outlook if it solves problems?
</I>
Maybe it solves the problem, maybe it doesn't.  General unix
philosophy is to not hide details from the end user.  If it's
intermittent then the next poll will solve it.  If it isn't, you
probably want to know when it really started.

&gt;<i> On the windows box they sometimes get
</I>&gt;<i>  mail box contains 85 messages with a total size of 18980048
</I>&gt;<i> receiving message no 27 (6755b)
</I>&gt;<i> connection error (winsock: returned by WSARecv or WSARecvFrom to indicate
</I>&gt;<i> the remote party has initiated a graceful shutdown sequence)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So it seems their windows also got problems?
</I>
Well, it seems your satellite link has the problem, which both myself
and Matthias have been saying from the start...

                 Please keep list traffic on the list.
