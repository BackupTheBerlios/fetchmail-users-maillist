Strange, nobody likes doing documentation :)

I think that, and a simple flow (diagram?) showing how it fits
together so people can more easily understand.  I suspect part of the
&quot;problem&quot; is that less technical people are using *nix these days,
meaning that previous assumptions are no longer valid (and that's in
general, not specific to fetchmail by any means).

Some form of diagnosis tool(s) wouldn't be a bad idea either, though
I've no idea what form that would take.  Enough to confirm that the
basic networking part is functional and that fetchmail can (or cannot)
talk to the remote server.

Well, I've got a few days off work now so II'll give this some more thought.

&gt;<i> I also think if you want to take a stab at splitting the FAQ, we can

</I>
Devel probably makes most sense and I am subscribed there (CCd for
this mail).  That way others can throw their 0.02$CURRENCY in :)

&gt;<i> You'll see I worded carefully to give my *personal* view, without any
</I>&gt;<i> hints towards what my right hand of the support should do, and I'd say
</I>&gt;<i> do what pleases *you* most, unless it's treating people without dignity.
</I>
Well, given that bugs will only be fixed in the current stable
version, there's little point in trying to support older versions
(which, IMO, is the right approach).

Beyond that, if people won't/don't/can't do what they're asked to do
then there's not really much point in continuing to flog the
proverbial horse.  In this case the OP did at least provide the
directly fetchmail related info, just nothing about his (unusual)
comms setup.
