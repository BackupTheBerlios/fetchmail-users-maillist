You're most welcome on this task - I haven't kept a close eye on what
part of the information is outdated and what not, and I've so far only
removed the most obvious stale stuff.

I'd like your view on this: Should we provide a short (1 - 2 pages if
printed) document on how to get support efficiently&quot; - perhaps along
DJB's[1] lines of 'what did you do, what did the computer do, what did
you expect' - ESR's smart questions is right, but long-winding for
someone who is on the verge of panicking.

I also think if you want to take a stab at splitting the FAQ, we can
arrange for Subversion access with Graham - let's take this part
off-list or to -devel however.

[1] don't mistake that as an appreciation of his support style, I'm just
    quoting one of his frequently asked questions...

&gt;<i> I think however I will, like Matthias, end up having to take a
</I>&gt;<i> somewhat harder line about helping people who don't/won't listen.  It
</I>&gt;<i> would be a shame however - I've been that clueless newbie and know how
</I>&gt;<i> much of a difference it makes to have somebody patiently lead you
</I>&gt;<i> towards enlightenment :)
</I>
You'll see I worded carefully to give my *personal* view, without any
hints towards what my right hand of the support should do, and I'd say
do what pleases *you* most, unless it's treating people without dignity.

Being a newbie is one thing, and I'm happy to read questions of the &quot;how
do you mean this and that&quot; kind if my instructions are too terse. But
just ignoring my questions without any response is below the threshold
where I stop caring - generally speaking.

Happy fetching
MA
