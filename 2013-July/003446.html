Hi Anton, *,

I am not entirely familiar with maillog because mail/postfix is one of
the ports I install soon after setting up FreeBSD, but I think the first
column is the count, the second the SMTP reject code.

Based on that assumption, it would seem that you've got five messages
with domains that do not resolve (451), and lots of messages that get
permanently rejected by your sendmail (553), and with &quot;set no
softbounce&quot;, fetchmail would delete those from the server because it
knows it will not ever be able to retrieve them.

If you were to &quot;set softbounce&quot;, you'd see more of them (for instance
zmjuia.com) because fetchmail would retry them.

Spam usually (ab)uses tons of domains so longish lists like yours

Looks like the whole setup works as intended, unless you have uncommon
requirements that you have not announced yet. :-)

So, as Rob suggested, you may want to delete those non-resolvable
messages from Google through the web interface. Fetchmail does not
employ a timeout or something, so these will stick.

(I haven't checked either of the related URLs that got posted in this
thread.)

Best regards
Matthias
