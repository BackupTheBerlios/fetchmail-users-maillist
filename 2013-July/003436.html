I suggest that you   D O    N O T    P A N I C .

And I need you to quickly understand that you have an operating system
problem,   N O T   a fetchmail problem.  Fetchmail is the messenger, not
the culprit nor cause.

Find out why your system libraries are failing to resolve, and fix that.
You have received enough pointers.

You may want to reconfigure launch* to re-launch fetchmail every 5
minutes or so, and disable daemon mode.  This may involve some shell
scripting, but a seasoned systems administrator does that in the
twinkling of an eye.


I am not willing to help you any further, I have had enough of being
shouted at for not being capable of clairvoyance.


&gt;<i> Let&#8217;s try your no dns option, but I don&#8217;t see any man page about what I&#8217;m supposed to write with that. Where can I find a sample conf for this option ??
</I>
Well, then see to that you have a man page.  It ships with fetchmail,
and it is available online.

If you cannot even manage to find either, then I suggest you realign.

Read the manual, and ask questions that reveal some hints that you have
actually read it.

Just don't expect me to copy and paste the introductory paragraphs to
the tables beneath each and every option... and do not expect people to
read the manual to you.  You need to do that yourself.

Of course you're free to hire a consultant... I am not available for
that now, however.
