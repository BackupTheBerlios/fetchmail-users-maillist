Do not jump to conclusions. You have not proven there is a causality
between your adding -vvv and the problem disappearing, you have only
observed a temporal coincidence.

With weeks between the experiments and DNS trouble, the data points you
have are also insufficient if you were to try and prove that.

I claim there is no problem and invite you to read driver.c, near line
1030 where you'll find fm_getaddrinfo() function calls, to see that
fetchmail only reports trouble it gets straight from the system, and if
you think there is an issue, I am happy to read your code-level
description of any bugs you will find.

I am not interested in guessing causalities where there are none.

You also have not provided any other starting points for a bug hunt,
you have not commented on my proposals made 2013-06-21, and I am not
reiterating my questions or assessments.

&gt;<i> and I&#8217;m sorry to be unable to share more details with you on this problem because I can&#8217;t get more !
</I>&gt;<i> If you&#8217;ve a Mac I can prepare a demo VM for you and you will see I
</I>&gt;<i> can&#8217;t offer more. It&#8217;s your code, not mine&#8230;
</I>
No Mac here.

No configuration or no logs =&gt; no way for me to help.  Plain and simple.

Given you do not observe the problem any longer, I suggest you retry
without the -vvv, and if that works again, put the issue to rest as a
temporary DNS issue.

If it recurs, debug the DNS on the offending system, and its DNS
servers, that's more worthwhile than pointing at software.  Note that
launchd provides a different environment than your sysadmin shell, you
must make sure to reproduce the launchd environment.  If resolver
configuration changes early during boot, you may want to make your
fetchmail launchd configuration delay the fetchmail start-up sufficiently.
