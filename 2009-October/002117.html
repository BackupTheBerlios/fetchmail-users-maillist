</I>Thank you for the reply Matthias, I went to DSLReports yesterday and
submitted the issue in the Embarq forum. Today I received this in an
email reply from Embarq dsl tech support:

&quot;I am sorry for the delayed response to your initial email. I do see
that you have been in contact with Embarq_Joey, our official tech on the
DSLReports.com forum. Embarq_Joey and I have been working together on
ensuring a resolution for you on this issue in a timely manner, and I
wanted to make sure I had a complete answer with information on the
resolution I replied. However, the process took longer than expected. It
was unprofessional for me to fail to reply to your message at least
acknowledging that we are working on the issue, and for this I take full
responsibility.&quot; 
 
&quot;The problem with the expired TLS certificate has been submitted to our
server engineers and they are working on a resolution as soon as
possible. In the meantime, if your email application allows you to
ignore the error and continue, please do this. If your email application
will not proceed without a renewed certificate, it may be necessary to
disable TLS certification until the issue has been resolved.&quot;

I'd also sent a nice email to Karen Puckett the COO of Century Link
which is who Embarq has merged with in July informing her of the
certificate issue. Luckily the certificate issue doesn't prevent me from
getting mail. I wonder how a company as large as Embarq/CenturyTel could
let a certificate expire?

Again, thank you and Rob for the suggestions.

Chris
