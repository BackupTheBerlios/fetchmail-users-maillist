</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I would like to suggest the following changes for upcoming versions
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of Fetchmail.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 1) The ability to use SMTP authentication.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I know I mentioned this several months ago; however, I feel it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; is still something that should be implemented. Several other
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; utilities already support this feature. I am somewhat surprised
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that Fetchmail does not. Having it do so would eliminate having to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; do creative configuring with Postfix on systems them employ full
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; SMTP authentication with TLS.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> For 6.4.X (requires proper modularization of SMTP/LMTP/BSMTP/MDA
</I>&gt;<i> sinks first), and I am still wondering about if and which SASL libary
</I>&gt;<i> to use (Cyrus vs. gsasl). I don't want to implement all that stuff
</I>&gt;<i> myself if others have already done it.
</I>
I would vote for Cyrus. It is the most widely used as far as I can
tell. Postfix uses it.

&gt;<i> &gt; 2) The ability to include both time and message ID in the Fetchmail
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; log file. Including the message ID would make back tracing an e-mail
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; eminently easier. Also, Fetchmail apparently does not have the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ability to check for its log file and create it if it doesn't exist.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Oh, it DOES check and deliberately does not log if the file is absent.
</I>&gt;<i> I think it's even documented.  The log rotation stuff I have
</I>&gt;<i> (newsyslog on FreeBSD, logrotate on Linux) can create empty files
</I>&gt;<i> after rotation, while the the restart part is pending.
</I>
I was under the impression that Fetchmail would not use a newly created
log file unless it was restarted. There was a thread a few months ago
dealing with this. By the way, I am using FreeBSD-8.0, not that it
matters here. In any case, the fact that it checks for its log file but
does not create it if absent seems kind of anti climatic. I would have
thought that the exact opposite behavior would have been instigated.

&gt;<i> &gt; That
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; behavior should be modified to include the ability to create its own
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; log file if it doesn't exist.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Message-ID would be worthwhile, but requires more work to make sure
</I>&gt;<i> it's present on all messages, and perhaps there are sequence numbers
</I>&gt;<i> that relate to the Message-ID so that those group properly.  Just the
</I>&gt;<i> Message-ID as the message header flies by might work, but isn't as
</I>&gt;<i> useful.
</I>
Displaying the message id in a similar fashion to what Postfix and
Dovecot does would be perfect for tracking a message if the need occurs.

Postfix:
Apr 23 15:15:11 scorpio postfix/cleanup[9992]: EBB0FE15408: message-id=&lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/fetchmail-users">20100423190559.9463037F551 at barracuda.sipri.org</A>&gt;

Dovecot:
Apr 23 15:15:11 deliver(<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/fetchmail-users">user at domain.com</A>): Info: sieve: msgid=&lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/fetchmail-users">20100423190559.9463037F551 at barracuda.sipri.org</A>&gt;: stored mail into mailbox 'INBOX'


&gt;<i> Not so sure about timestamps. OTOH, most of the logging is supposed
</I>&gt;<i> to go through report(), so would probably be reasonably simple to do.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 3) The ability to rotate Fetchmail's log files without shutting
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Fetchmail down. Virtually every daemon that I am familiar with has
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; this feature. Whether using a standard signal or a custom one
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (similar to Clamav):
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 30    SIGUSR1      terminate process    User defined signal 1
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 31    SIGUSR2      terminate process    User defined signal 2
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Well... for the nonce, as Rob suggests, syslog helps with that, and
</I>&gt;<i> with timestamping, too. :)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In the long run I expect the whole logging to be revised.
</I>
I all ready addressed this is my reply to Rob.

&gt;<i> &gt; I realize that this is not going to happen over night, or perhaps
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ever. I just think it is something for the developers to consider.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yes. Just considered. :)
</I>
That is all I asked. By the way, thanks for the extremely quick
response. I really did not expect to get one for several days, if at
all.
