<PRE>This is a short user poll. It is meant to figure out what people think how  
a particular SSL/TLS option should behave, so I can gear the upcoming  
6.3.17 release to create least surprises. The poll is free-form, on the  
list, and runs until I feel I have sufficient feedback.


Background:

* for a SSL or TLS connection, the server presents its server certificate  
(and possibly those of intermediate certification authorities in the  
so-called &quot;certificate chain&quot; if an entire hierarchy of SSL/TLS  
signing/trusting authorities is used) to fetchmail. Fetchmail validates  
those certificates, and checks if finds the certificate of the &quot;root&quot;  
certification authorities (issuer, signer) in one of the locations where  
OpenSSL or the fetchmail user keeps trusted certificates (see below).

* fetchmail versions 6.3.1 and newer have either used certificates from  
the directory you specified with --sslcertpath, or those from the default  
OpenSSL locations (usually /etc/ssl/certs, /usr/ssl/certs, or  
/usr/lib/ssl/certs, and the default CAfile). 6.3.0 and older have never  
loaded the default OpenSSL locations, which was considered a bug by users  
and fixed.

* OpenSSL actually allows adding multiple locations (in an  
include-as-well) where it is supposed to look for the certificates. It  
will search all of them, in a particular order. We need not decide for  
just one.

* I have committed a patch for the future version 6.3.17 that adds  
--sslcertfile so that fetchmail can use a CA bundle file in a non-default  
location. This is to obviate the need to run c_rehash.

* OpenSSL 1.0.0 (new) uses a different hash function for the directories  
you give to --sslcertpath MYCADIR than OpenSSL 0.9.8 (widespread in  
distributions) and older used to use. This caused bogus bug reports that  
fetchmail 6.3.16 broke SSL for users when they forgot to run &quot;c_rehash  
MYCADIR&quot;.

The two poll questions are:

(1) Should fetchmail add the default OpenSSL certificate locations even if  
you specify --sslcertfile or --sslcertpath? You will be able to choose the  
other behaviour by setting an environment variable (I don't plan to add  
yet another option). Optional: why?
Explanation:
  - yes means that fetchmail would look into the OpenSSL default locations  
AND additionally into those you specify. From a usability point of view  
this option is preferred, because Linux, *BSD and other distributions will  
often run c_rehash on the system directories automatically, so that this  
can mask the user's forgetting to run c_rehash.
  - no means that fetchmail will only look into those you specify. If  
neither of these two options are present, fetchmail will instead look into  
the OpenSSL default places. This is preferable from a security point of  
view, to only look into specified locations in order to be as mistrustful  
as possible.

(2) If you answered the previous one with &quot;yes&quot;, should the fetchmail or  
the OpenSSL directories be checked first?

Thank you.
