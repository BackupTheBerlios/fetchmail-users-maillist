&gt;<i> I would like to suggest the following changes for upcoming versions of
</I>&gt;<i> Fetchmail.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1) The ability to use SMTP authentication.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I know I mentioned this several months ago; however, I feel it
</I>&gt;<i> is still something that should be implemented. Several other utilities
</I>&gt;<i> already support this feature. I am somewhat surprised that Fetchmail
</I>&gt;<i> does not. Having it do so would eliminate having to do creative
</I>&gt;<i> configuring with Postfix on systems them employ full SMTP
</I>&gt;<i> authentication with TLS.
</I>
For 6.4.X (requires proper modularization of SMTP/LMTP/BSMTP/MDA sinks first),
and I am still wondering about if and which SASL libary to use (Cyrus vs.
gsasl). I don't want to implement all that stuff myself if others have already
done it.

&gt;<i> 2) The ability to include both time and message ID in the Fetchmail log
</I>&gt;<i> file. Including the message ID would make back tracing an e-mail
</I>&gt;<i> eminently easier. Also, Fetchmail apparently does not have the ability
</I>&gt;<i> to check for its log file and create it if it doesn't exist.
</I>
Oh, it DOES check and deliberately does not log if the file is absent.
I think it's even documented.  The log rotation stuff I have (newsyslog on
FreeBSD, logrotate on Linux) can create empty files after rotation, while the
the restart part is pending.

&gt;<i> That
</I>&gt;<i> behavior should be modified to include the ability to create its own
</I>&gt;<i> log file if it doesn't exist.
</I>
Message-ID would be worthwhile, but requires more work to make sure it's present
on all messages, and perhaps there are sequence numbers that relate to the
Message-ID so that those group properly.  Just the Message-ID as the message
header flies by might work, but isn't as useful.

Not so sure about timestamps. OTOH, most of the logging is supposed to go
through report(), so would probably be reasonably simple to do.

&gt;<i> 3) The ability to rotate Fetchmail's log files without shutting
</I>&gt;<i> Fetchmail down. Virtually every daemon that I am familiar with has this
</I>&gt;<i> feature. Whether using a standard signal or a custom one (similar to
</I>&gt;<i> Clamav):
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 30    SIGUSR1      terminate process    User defined signal 1
</I>&gt;<i> 31    SIGUSR2      terminate process    User defined signal 2
</I>
Well... for the nonce, as Rob suggests, syslog helps with that, and with
timestamping, too. :)

In the long run I expect the whole logging to be revised.

&gt;<i> I realize that this is not going to happen over night, or perhaps ever.
</I>&gt;<i> I just think it is something for the developers to consider.
</I>
Yes. Just considered. :)
