Depends on the syslog implementation you're using:

rsyslog, now in use on many Linux distributions, allows filtering.

FreeBSD's syslog, for instance, allows filtering per program.

For both, you'd add this to the end of your [r]syslog.conf:

!fetchmail
*.*                                             /var/log/fetchmail.log

and Rob posted an example for syslog-ng.conf if you're using syslog-ng.

&gt;<i> All of the daemons I mentioned, and several I haven't have the ability

</I>&gt;<i> incidence. I would think that it is doable in Fetchmail as well. Then
</I>&gt;<i> again, I have been known to be wrong on rare occasions! :-D
</I>
That's why the syslog concept has been proposed. :)

I think for 6.3 support for log rotation is not easily (if at all)
implementable, because it basically just redirects stdio descriptors,
and getting everything right is a hell of a lot of work for this
particular change. It takes you a few minutes, but me likely hours, if
not days.

In the end, all this is duplicating effort that's already been
successfully spent elsewhere.  This is just to let you know that this
particular feature is pretty low priority for me. You can always stop
fetchmail and restart it if you want its logfile feature.

Hope you're not too disappointed.

Best regards
Matthias
