<PRE>I would like to suggest the following changes for upcoming versions of
Fetchmail.

1) The ability to use SMTP authentication.

I know I mentioned this several months ago; however, I feel it
is still something that should be implemented. Several other utilities
already support this feature. I am somewhat surprised that Fetchmail
does not. Having it do so would eliminate having to do creative
configuring with Postfix on systems them employ full SMTP
authentication with TLS.

2) The ability to include both time and message ID in the Fetchmail log
file. Including the message ID would make back tracing an e-mail
eminently easier. Also, Fetchmail apparently does not have the ability
to check for its log file and create it if it doesn't exist. That
behavior should be modified to include the ability to create its own
log file if it doesn't exist.

3) The ability to rotate Fetchmail's log files without shutting
Fetchmail down. Virtually every daemon that I am familiar with has this
feature. Whether using a standard signal or a custom one (similar to
Clamav):

30    SIGUSR1      terminate process    User defined signal 1
31    SIGUSR2      terminate process    User defined signal 2

I realize that this is not going to happen over night, or perhaps ever.
I just think it is something for the developers to consider.
