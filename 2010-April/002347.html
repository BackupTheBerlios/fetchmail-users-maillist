Or just ditch it and use maildrop instead, which is much nicer WRT error  
handling.
You're not doing anything fancy here.

&gt;&gt;<i> These would share the .fetchids and .fetchmail.pid lock files, so for

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> could be used.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You lost me with this one. Could you expand on it?

Already done, in the manpage:


ENVIRONMENT
[...]
        FETCHMAILHOME: If the environment variable FETCHMAILHOME is  set   
to  a
        valid  and  existing  directory  name,  fetchmail will read  
$FETCHMAIL-
        HOME/fetchmailrc  (the  dot  is  missing  in  this  case),   
$FETCHMAIL-
        HOME/.fetchids  and  $FETCHMAILHOME/.fetchmail.pid rather than from  
the
        user&#8217;s home directory.  The .netrc file is always looked for in the  
the
        invoking user&#8217;s home directory regardless of FETCHMAILHOME&#8217;s  
setting.

        HOME_ETC:  If  the  HOME_ETC  variable  is  set,  fetchmail  will   
read
        $HOME_ETC/.fetchmailrc instead of ~/.fetchmailrc.

        If HOME_ETC and FETCHMAILHOME are both set, HOME_ETC will be  
ignored.

If you use separate FETCHMAILHOME settings for your fetchmail instances,  
you can run several fetchmail processes in parallel. It's not normally  
possible.

&gt;&gt;<i> But fetchmail must surely have passed them somewhere (run with -v to  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> see if it talks SMTP, LMTP, to a command) - possibly a default  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> exim/postfix/sendmail installation from the distribution Robert is  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> using? Is fetchmail configured for a &quot;fallback&quot; MDA?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm running Alpine which communicates directly with the smtp server,  
</I>&gt;<i> hence no need for an mda. Also I'm running Ubuntu which doesn't install  
</I>&gt;<i> a default mda.
</I>
I think there's a misunderstanding here; fetchmail has nothing to do with  
how you *SEND* mail (SMTP), but how it gets onto your system. There are:

Mail Transfer Agents (MTA): Postfix, Exim, Sendmail, Courier, ZMailer...
Some of these include a local delivery agent, or can deliver locally,  
traditionally to /var/(spool/)mail/$LOGNAME.

Mail Delivery Agents (MDA): Procmail (decrepit), Maildrop, ...
These can only deliver locally and sometimes also filter.


Regarding Ubuntu: If there isn't a mail-transfer-agent installed on your  
system, and you're not configuring an mda, then fetchmail would have to  
leave messages on the server because there's nowhere it can deliver to. I  
don't have pristine Ubuntu systems to test this though.

On a related note, fetchmail is way outdated on all Ubuntu versions,  
including Lucid Lynx (10.04) Beta.  I'd appreciate if Ubuntu users could  
push them to release an up-to-date package for LTS, perhaps even provide  
patches to update the Ubuntu package to what is in Debian/unstable...

&gt;<i> Finally got it to work with a procmail filter looking at the Received  
</I>&gt;<i> header. From the procmail log:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   69  ## procmail: Match on &quot;^Received: from pop.sonic.net&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks to you and Michael for your patience.
</I>&gt;<i>
