<PRE>Greetings,

#1 I am asking interested fetchmail users to test a preview release of
fetchmail. Change details are below.

#2 Also, if you can offer access to test servers that I can send a short
test mail to and then log into to retrieve that test message -
particularly Exchange 2007 is desired, but others besides Cyrus IMAP and
Dovecot are also welcome - please let me know.

#3 Finally, fetchmail needs translators for the program strings. Some
languages (such as those shown below) are in quite good shape, but
others are lacking a bit.

Translation information at
&lt;<A HREF="http://translationproject.org/domain/fetchmail.html">http://translationproject.org/domain/fetchmail.html</A>&gt;

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

DOWNLOAD this beta software from:
&lt;<A HREF="http://home.pages.de/~mandree/fetchmail/">http://home.pages.de/~mandree/fetchmail/</A>&gt;

The repository can be browsed at and cloned from:
&lt;<A HREF="http://gitorious.org/fetchmail/fetchmail">http://gitorious.org/fetchmail/fetchmail</A>&gt;

Git (the software used to keep the fetchmail source code version
controlled) information is at: &lt;<A HREF="http://git-scm.com/">http://git-scm.com/</A>&gt;

CHANGES since the previous formal release of fetchmail listed below.
Unless otherwise noted, the changes were made by Matthias Andree:

# SECURITY FIX
* CVE-2010-1167: Fetchmail before release 6.3.17 did not properly sanitize
  external input (mail headers and UID). When a multi-character locale (such as
  UTF-8) was in use, this could cause memory exhaustion and thus a denial of
  service, because fetchmail's report.c functions assumed that non-success of
  [v]snprintf was due to insufficient buffer size allocation. It would then
  repeatedly reallocate a larger buffer and fail formatting again.
  See fetchmail-SA-2010-02.txt.

# FEATURES
* Fetchmail now supports a --sslcertfile &lt;file&gt; option to specify a &quot;CA bundle&quot;
  file (a file that contains trusted CA certificates). Since these bundled CA
  files do not require c_rehash to be run, they are easier to use and immune to
  OpenSSL library updates that affect the hash function.
* Fetchmail now supports a FETCHMAIL_INCLUDE_DEFAULT_X509_CA_CERTS
  environment variable to force loading the default SSL CA certificate
  locations.

# REGRESSION FIX
* Fix string handling in rcfile scanner, which caused fetchmail to misparse a
  run control file in certain circumstances.  Fixes BerliOS bug #14257.
  Patch by Michael Banack.  This fixes a regression introduced before 6.3.0.

# BUG FIXES
* Plug memory leak when using a &quot;defaults&quot; entry in the run control file.
* Do not print SSL certificate mismatches unless verbose or --sslcertck is
  enabled.
* Do not lose &quot;set invisible&quot; in fetchmailconf. (Michael Barnack)

# CHANGES
* Usability: SSL certificate chains are fully printed in -v -v mode, and there
  are now helpful pointers to --sslcertpath and c_rehash for &quot;unable to get
  local issuer certificate&quot; and self-signed certificates -- these usually hint
  to missing root signing CAs in the certs directory.
* Several fixes for compiler (GCC, Intel C++, CLang) and autotools warnings
* Memory allocation failures will now cause abnormal program abort (SIGABRT),
  not exit with unspecified code.

# DOCUMENTATION
* Fix table of global option to read &quot;set softbounce&quot; where there used to be a
  2nd copy of &quot;set spambounce&quot;.  Patch by Michael Banack, BerliOS Bug #17067.
* In the --sslcertpath description, mention that OpenSSL upgrade (and a 0.9.X
  to 1.0.0 upgrade in particular) may require running c_rehash.

# KNOWN BUGS AND WORKAROUNDS:
  (this section floats upwards through the NEWS file so it stays with the
  current release information - however, it was stuck with 6.3.8 for a while)
* fetchmail does not handle messages without Message-ID header well
  (See sourceforge.net bug #780933)
* BSMTP is mostly untested and errors can cause corrupt output.
* Sun Workshop 6 (SPARC) is known to miscompile the configuration file lexer in
  64-bit mode.  Either compile 32-bit code or use GCC to compile 64-bit
  fetchmail.  Note that fetchmail doesn't take advantage of 64-bit code,
  so compiling 32-bit SPARC code should not cause any difficulties.
* fetchmail does not track pending deletes over crashes
* the command line interface is sometimes a bit stubborn, for instance,
  fetchmail -s doesn't work with a daemon running
