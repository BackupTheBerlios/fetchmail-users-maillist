It's a bit irritating to find someone who confuses SFTP and FTP calling his
customers &quot;somewhat lame&quot;, don't you think?

&gt;<i> I don't understand one thing - are you here to help me with a bug or tell me how
</I>&gt;<i> to run a company?

In a volunteer project, nobody is obliged to help anyone with anything -
either the volunteer supporters are volunteering to help, or they aren't.
And I can perfectly understand if they lose interest if being shouted at,
told down, coerced, whatever.

Given that the claim of a &quot;bug&quot; is not unconvincing considering the meagre
evidence presented so far, and given that all support is on a voluntary
basis: do calm down, will you?

Either there are strong hints there is a fetchmail bug (and &quot;socket error&quot;
usually points in the opposite direction) and we can arrange a systematic
search, or we'll stop the discussion right now.

&gt;<i> I am asking for help on something that others have occured too and not just me -
</I>&gt;<i> if you can put your opinions on how things should work (and believe me - i know)
</I>&gt;<i> and help me with the bug I will very much appreciate it.
</I>
I'd like to chime in with the &quot;mail is not for file transfer&quot; choir though.

So compile fetchmail, gcc users should use CFLAGS=&quot;-O -ggdb3&quot;, run it under
a debugger, put breakpoints on every line that returns PS_SOCKET (sorry, I
don't have a list, grep -n PS_SOCKET *.c on the fetchmail source should
help), and if a breakpoint is hit, obtain a stack backtrace, and at the
same time, log the network connections with tcpdump or wireshark/tshark so
we can see how fetchmail's behaviour relates to what goes over the wire -
that might be a constructive approach, but I'm not making promises here, it
might very well be the problem is still beyond any application's powers.
