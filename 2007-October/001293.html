<PRE>&gt;<i> Looks basically ok.  You probably don't need/want the fetchlimit, and
</I>
Agreed.  I added this as part an earlier troubleshooting effort.  I've
verified that changing this has no effect on the problem.

&gt;<i> Those &quot;^M&quot; symbols are worrying - is your .fetchmailrc file in DOS format?
</I>
Nope.

linux:~# sed l &lt;/etc/fetchmailrc | grep '\\r'
linux:~#

I'd guess fetchmail is getting that extra \r from parsing the mail
headers.  The end of every mail header line has a \r\n sequence,
including the ones with addresses.  I've confirmed that several dozen
successfully delivered messages have this exact same output in my
fetchmail debug log.  It appears every message I receive looks this
way (i.e. this doesn't seem to be a problem).

&gt;<i> &gt; 12:56.516414 IMAP&lt; A0011 OK FETCH completed.
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;---SNIP---&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 17:56.536700 timeout after 300 seconds waiting for server mail..
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Remote mail server stopped responding.
</I>
Not true.  You can plainly see that immediately after the &quot;OK FETCH
completed&quot; message fetchmail issues a &quot;FETCH 618 BODY&quot; command, which
receives a response within 2ms.  The problem is that the response is a
&quot;NO&quot; response, not the &quot;FETCH&quot; response fetchmail is expecting.

Fetchmail is expecting to see &quot;FETCH&quot; in the response, and blocks
waiting for it, eventually timing out.  Fetchmail is executing this
code:

------ start code ------
if ((ok = gen_recv(sock, buf, sizeof(buf))))
   return(ok);
} while
(!strstr(buf+4, &quot;FETCH&quot;) || sscanf(buf+2, &quot;%d&quot;, &amp;num) != 1);
------ end code ------

This code ensures fetchmail cannot proceed until a &quot;FETCH&quot; response is
received.  This behavior in imap_fetch_body() is fails to comply with
RFC2060 section 7.1.2 regarding the handling of &quot;NO&quot; error responses,
based on my interpretation.

In summary fetchmail issues a command to fetch the body, but instead
of receiving the body it receives a &quot;NO&quot; response.  Fetchmail doesn't
properly handle this and blocks forever, eventually timing out.
Unfortunately, by this time fetchmail has already delivered the
message headers to procmail, which means my mail client receives a
message with headers, but no body.
