<PRE>Greetings,

fetchmail's mimedecode feature, contributed by Henrik Storner and added
by ESR in 1998 and shipped in release 4.4.1 for the first time, can
damage MIME parts in various ways, so I consider it broken.


During debugging I found quite a few limitations in the source code that
make the whole mimedecode feature (the way it is in fetchmail 6.3.20)
rather questionable to me, and I am seriously considering removing
mimedecode altogether, rather than fixing the many bugs and flaws.

Details are given below the questions:

1. WHO is using the mimedecode feature? If you do, please reply; either
to the list, or if you're not subscribed and don't feel like
subscribing, directly to my mail address. Please keep the Subject.

2. WHAT purposes are you using mimedecode for?  Can you abstain from
fetchmail's mimedecode feature with reasonable effort?

3. HAVE YOU HAD ISSUES with mimedecode yet, such as wrong character
sets, corrupted messages, and similar?

4. Is someone capable and willing to contribute high-quality bug fixes
and code additions to get this feature to work? The resulting code
should be license compatible with GPL v2 or later, and ideally with
Affero GPL v3 or later.


Limitations of the mimedecode feature as of fetchmail 6.3.20 as I see
them today:


1. headers: mimedecode does not convert character sets. Documented in
the source code, but the code makes unwarranted assumptions.  Corruption
likely if the message uses an incompatible character set.

Effort to fix: medium, probably &lt;10 hours for a minimal fix (convert to
one single charset/encoding, such as UTF-8).


2. header quoting: There is a related Debian bug #475239 documenting a
lack of quoting when decoding ends up with special characters, for
instance, commas in a &quot;Doe, John&quot; notation.  This causes
misinterpretation of decoded headers in the mailer later on.

Effort to fix unclear, probably 10...100 hours.


3. body soft line breaks: MIME quoted-printable supports line
continuations (a trailing &quot;=&quot;), designating &quot;here was /no/ line ending
in the original text&quot;. Fetchmail

  a. inserts CRLF roughly every 8 K of text if the input lines are
longer than that;

Effort to fix unclear, likely easier in next (C++-based) major release
and then &lt; 10 hours, possibly &lt; 20 h in 6.X releases with some code
reshuffling.

  b. forgets to ship the last line of a single-part message if it ends
in a soft (i. e. &quot;no&quot;) line break.

Fix works for me and sent to original reporter for confirmation.


4. body nesting: I have skimmed through the code and, without conducting
a full audit, have reason to assume that the mimedecode feature cannot
handle nested multipart messages and will fail and possibly mutilate the
messages after the end of the first inner nested part. This affects
multipart messages forwarded as attachments, for instance.

Medium effort to fix, probably ~30 hours.



For me as programmer, there is a good opportunity to remove
the &quot;mimedecode&quot; feature, rather than spend substantial amounts of time
into getting this right.

There will be a cleanup release of fetchmail anyways that will drop
support for outdated pre-SUSv3 systems (not compliant to 2001's IEEE Std
1003.1), POP2/POP3 LAST (superseded by POP3 UIDL more than 10 years
ago), IMAP2 (superseded by IMAP4rev1), SSLv2 (superseded by SSLv3 and
TLSv1), Kerberos IV/5 (superseded by GSS/GSSAPI) and various other
(mis)features in order to make the code more robust and maintainable,
and enable some modernizations that overcome older limitations in the code.

</PRE>
