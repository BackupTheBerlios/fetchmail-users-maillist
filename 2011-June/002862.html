Jack,

silent connection change on the laptop, without signalling applications,
can take extended amounts of time for fetchmail to notice, or for any
application for that matter.

Fetchmail doesn't expect a message from the server sooner than 28
minutes after sending the IDLE command, and even if fetchmail itself
cancels the idle command to avoid a server disconnect after 30 minutes,
it will take a few more minutes after sending the DONE before fetchmail
concludes that the server does not reply - maybe 33 minutes, maybe 35
minutes after sending the IDLE command, maybe even more, depending on OS
and configuration.

If you can arrange for your whole setup to reset all current connections
when the connection of IP changes, that would help.

Alternatively, you can configure a lower timeout, perhaps 60, per the
rcfile or command line, and you change imap.c -- there is just one line
reading

	mytimeout = idle_timeout = 1680; /* 28 min */

1680 is 60 * 28, you can change that, for instance, to 300, and
fetchmail will cancel the IDLE command after 5 minutes.

Given all the various restrictions (most notably that it only works
reasonably well if there is exactly one folder on one server to poll)
and sharp edges around IDLE mode, I wonder if I should just remove it
for the 6.4.0 release.


BTW, any news on the logging and comparison of your Exchange 2003
problem? Did you receive the logging patch I sent separately a couple of
days ago?

Best regards,
Matthias
