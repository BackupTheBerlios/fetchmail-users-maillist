&gt;<i> I have been using Fetchmail for some years and it is currently
</I>&gt;<i> functioning correctly and doing what is required, but I'm thinking it
</I>&gt;<i> might be possible to optimize its operation and I hoped some experts
</I>&gt;<i> would be able to make a few suggestions.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Currently I have a MacOSX (mail &amp; other) server and several Mac and
</I>&gt;<i> Windows clients, all accessing their mail on the server via IMAP, so
</I>&gt;<i> one user who might be using several different machines (i.e. me) can
</I>&gt;<i> always access up to date mail. Fetchmail runs on the server in daemon
</I>&gt;<i> mode and as directed by a single configuration file, collects mail for
</I>&gt;<i> all accounts at 10 min. intervals and it all works. But I have 2
</I>&gt;<i> issues I'd like to improve on, although in fact it might be considered
</I>&gt;<i> the same issue - I want to improve the scheduling.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My first thought was to use IMAP IDLE so the mail would be 'fetched'
</I>&gt;<i> according to when it arrived at the ISP, but I could do with some help
</I>&gt;<i> regarding how this functions in fetchmail since the manual states it
</I>&gt;<i> currently only works on one folder at a time and I really can't figure
</I>&gt;<i> what this means. My config file describes one server and several
</I>&gt;<i> users, does that mean it could only be triggered by mail arriving at
</I>&gt;<i> one of those users? Or only a single folder for each user? If the
</I>&gt;<i> latter, then not a problem since there is only the INBOX that would
</I>&gt;<i> contain relevant mail, but if it's the former, would running a
</I>&gt;<i> separate instance of fetchmail for each user with its own config file
</I>&gt;<i> solve that?
</I>
Hi Ken,

the feature's current support is &quot;for IDLE, one folder per running  
fetchmail instance, no matter how many accounts and folders there are&quot;.
That would be the first folder in the first user's account (in the  
first/only server). In your setup, you cannot use fetchmail's idle  
support. Major parts of fetchmail have to be rewritten to support that.

If all users had only their INBOX polled, you could get away by fixing one  
fetchmailrc per user, in a subdirectory, and run an fetchmail instance for  
each, with the environmental variable FETCHMAILHOME set. Less convenient  
to set up, but then per-user restrictions were circumvented.

However:

&gt;<i> The next problem is that my ISP doesn't support IDLE. Can anyone
</I>&gt;<i> suggest how to get around this? Does anyone know of a service that
</I>&gt;<i> could offer say half a dozen mailboxes and that could 'push' email to
</I>&gt;<i> fetchmail, yet also provide webmail for when my system is not
</I>&gt;<i> running ? I could arrange a static IP address if required, but in any
</I>&gt;<i> case I can only see IMAP and IDLE as being able to offer all that.
</I>
...that's a major obstacle. Without IMAP IDLE support, any --idle efforts  
are... um, idle.

The alternatives are
- lowering the poll interval to as low as the ISP permits (you'd thought  
about that, see below)
- use your own SMTP server on a static IP.

&gt;<i> My other approach was to try and control the poll interval according
</I>&gt;<i> to usage. Perhaps only run fetchmail for a user when actually logged
</I>&gt;<i> in? Trouble is the users do not log in to the server so it would be
</I>&gt;<i> tricky to ascertain whether that mail client was up and running or
</I>&gt;<i> maybe the whole machine was asleep. What about running fetchmail on
</I>&gt;<i> the client machines? Apart from the fact that it would have to fetch
</I>&gt;<i> the mail then pass it to the local server to then be able to download
</I>&gt;<i> it back from that server with the mail client (Apple's Mail.app) which
</I>&gt;<i> all seems to involve a lot of tooing and froing, if one user (me
</I>&gt;<i> again) needs to be able to be logged in on more than one machine, how
</I>&gt;<i> could I make those all interact correctly and avoid multiple instances
</I>&gt;<i> of fetchmail (i.e. one on each machine on which I have an active
</I>&gt;<i> login) all trying to do the same thing?
</I>
I'd avoid that. It requires proper mail setup on all of the machines, and  
miniscule differences can throw the whole mail system over for a certain  
client, or user, or both.

&gt;<i> Finally, I want to run fetchmail from launchd, so I guess I  use the -
</I>&gt;<i> N option to not detach, but how can I change the polling frequency of
</I>&gt;<i> the running daemon? I could set it up with a large interval as the
</I>&gt;<i> default and then just call fetchmail on a more frequent basis and wake
</I>&gt;<i> it up when required, but how could I change the rate with a single
</I>&gt;<i> command? Could I just run the original command again, but with a
</I>&gt;<i> different -dnnn? Would I need to quit it first?
</I>
Assuming launchd respawns fetchmail if it quits for whatever reason:
Just use -N -d 600 (adjust as you see fit) as you would do otherwise - you  
can safely combine these two options.

That's also workable in SysV-style inittab, Upstart (on Ubuntu for  
instance), with daemontools, with runit, or with Solaris's Service  
Management Framework SMF.
