<PRE>I have been using Fetchmail for some years and it is currently  
functioning correctly and doing what is required, but I'm thinking it  
might be possible to optimize its operation and I hoped some experts  
would be able to make a few suggestions.

Currently I have a MacOSX (mail &amp; other) server and several Mac and  
Windows clients, all accessing their mail on the server via IMAP, so  
one user who might be using several different machines (i.e. me) can  
always access up to date mail. Fetchmail runs on the server in daemon  
mode and as directed by a single configuration file, collects mail for  
all accounts at 10 min. intervals and it all works. But I have 2  
issues I'd like to improve on, although in fact it might be considered  
the same issue - I want to improve the scheduling.

My first thought was to use IMAP IDLE so the mail would be 'fetched'  
according to when it arrived at the ISP, but I could do with some help  
regarding how this functions in fetchmail since the manual states it  
currently only works on one folder at a time and I really can't figure  
what this means. My config file describes one server and several  
users, does that mean it could only be triggered by mail arriving at  
one of those users? Or only a single folder for each user? If the  
latter, then not a problem since there is only the INBOX that would  
contain relevant mail, but if it's the former, would running a  
separate instance of fetchmail for each user with its own config file  
solve that?

The next problem is that my ISP doesn't support IDLE. Can anyone  
suggest how to get around this? Does anyone know of a service that  
could offer say half a dozen mailboxes and that could 'push' email to  
fetchmail, yet also provide webmail for when my system is not  
running ? I could arrange a static IP address if required, but in any  
case I can only see IMAP and IDLE as being able to offer all that.

My other approach was to try and control the poll interval according  
to usage. Perhaps only run fetchmail for a user when actually logged  
in? Trouble is the users do not log in to the server so it would be  
tricky to ascertain whether that mail client was up and running or  
maybe the whole machine was asleep. What about running fetchmail on  
the client machines? Apart from the fact that it would have to fetch  
the mail then pass it to the local server to then be able to download  
it back from that server with the mail client (Apple's Mail.app) which  
all seems to involve a lot of tooing and froing, if one user (me  
again) needs to be able to be logged in on more than one machine, how  
could I make those all interact correctly and avoid multiple instances  
of fetchmail (i.e. one on each machine on which I have an active  
login) all trying to do the same thing?

Finally, I want to run fetchmail from launchd, so I guess I  use the - 
N option to not detach, but how can I change the polling frequency of  
the running daemon? I could set it up with a large interval as the  
default and then just call fetchmail on a more frequent basis and wake  
it up when required, but how could I change the rate with a single  
command? Could I just run the original command again, but with a  
different -dnnn? Would I need to quit it first?

So, no great technical problems here, but I'd appreciate comments on  
how I might improve my setup and maybe solve some of these issues.

Thanks.
