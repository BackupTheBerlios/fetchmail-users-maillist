</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  Currently I am having a problem when using UIDL that I am getting
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> extra copies of some emails.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Are these extra copies or perhaps real intended copies? Check all headers,
</I>&gt;<i> if there is only one difference (except in the Received: header written by
</I>&gt;<i> fetchmail and those Received: headers that appear above fetchmail's), it's
</I>&gt;<i> not a copy.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>No these are definitely unwanted copies.  That is the first thing that I 
checked.
The number of copies that are created varies between 0 to 3 extra copies 
with no logic to it.
&gt;&gt;<i>  I have been monitoring the .fetchids file and have noticed that it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> will grow to just a little larger then 212000 bytes in size and then
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> shrinks back down again.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  Is there a maximum size that this file can be?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Usually what your operating system and hardware can handle - it is kept in
</I>&gt;<i> memory with a reasonable overhead per line; but no artificial limits are
</I>&gt;<i> imposed by fetchmail itself. 
</I>The OS is CentOS 5 and the hardware is a Dell PowerEdge in a production 
environment with no gui's installed so there should be more then enough 
memory.  Currently Fetchmail is pulling email for many different email 
addresses but always running as the same user.  (IE it may pull email 
for you or me but the program that calls it always starts it as the same 
user regardless of who it is pulling email for)
Is there a maximum number of lines that can be process in the .fetchids 
file?  (IE is this handled by an array that has an upper limit?)

&gt;<i> It may also be that the server expires older
</I>&gt;<i> and/or downloaded messages after some time, and if the influx of mail over
</I>&gt;<i> time is roughly constant, that would explain why the file size also remains
</I>&gt;<i> sort of constant.
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>Our userbase is growing so I think that this should be growing too.  
Does the .fetchids file stay in sync with the external servers that it 
gets its information from? (IE If an email is removed from an external 
server, will fetchmail see that and remove the unique id from the 
.fetchids file?)
&gt;<i> Check the computer's memory (memtest86+ for x86/amd64 computers) and fans
</I>&gt;<i> and heat sinks, and if very dusty, clean them.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (Note that there's an order of magnitude missing, 212000 are rather 0.2
</I>&gt;<i> than 2 Mb).
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>Sorry dropped a 0.  Should be 2120000.
