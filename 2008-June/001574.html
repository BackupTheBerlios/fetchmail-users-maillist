</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Usually what your operating system and hardware can handle - it is kept in
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> memory with a reasonable overhead per line; but no artificial limits are
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> imposed by fetchmail itself. 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>       
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The OS is CentOS 5 and the hardware is a Dell PowerEdge in a production 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> environment with no gui's installed so there should be more then enough 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> memory.  Currently Fetchmail is pulling email for many different email 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So - given it's a PowerEdge, does it use ECC memory and hardware
</I>&gt;<i> (temperature) surveillance facilities and kill your ears with some kind
</I>&gt;<i> of alarm if something goes wrong?
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>Yes, alarms will sound on the server.  As well, emails will be sent to 
the sys admins if there is a problem.
&gt;<i>   
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> addresses but always running as the same user.  (IE it may pull email 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> for you or me but the program that calls it always starts it as the same 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> user regardless of who it is pulling email for)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Should not influence that situation, except if you share the .fetchids
</I>&gt;<i> file between accounts - I don't know how you would manage to do that
</I>&gt;<i> though, because fetchmail records the login and target host along with
</I>&gt;<i> the UIDs.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Is there a maximum number of lines that can be process in the .fetchids 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> file?  (IE is this handled by an array that has an upper limit?)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> No fixed limits, as long as it can allocate memory, no problem there.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Our userbase is growing so I think that this should be growing too.  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Does the .fetchids file stay in sync with the external servers that it 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> gets its information from? (IE If an email is removed from an external 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> server, will fetchmail see that and remove the unique id from the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> .fetchids file?)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, it will. Anything suspicious in the mail logs?
</I>&gt;<i> Notices, Warnings, Errors?
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>Nothing suspicious in the logs.
&gt;<i> What kind of upstream server is fetchmail getting its mail from, might
</I>&gt;<i> that one goof up UIDs?
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>Pulling mail from a variety of external mail servers but the one that 
gives us the most problems is secureservers.net (godaddy) and domains 
that are hosted by it.

As the duplication does seem to be limited to one isp, I don't think 
that the problem is caused outside its own server.
&gt;<i> Best regards

Thanks again,
