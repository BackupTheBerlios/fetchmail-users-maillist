&gt;<i> &gt; Usually what your operating system and hardware can handle - it is kept in

</I>&gt;<i> The OS is CentOS 5 and the hardware is a Dell PowerEdge in a production 
</I>&gt;<i> environment with no gui's installed so there should be more then enough 
</I>&gt;<i> memory.  Currently Fetchmail is pulling email for many different email 
</I>
So - given it's a PowerEdge, does it use ECC memory and hardware
(temperature) surveillance facilities and kill your ears with some kind
of alarm if something goes wrong?

&gt;<i> addresses but always running as the same user.  (IE it may pull email 
</I>&gt;<i> for you or me but the program that calls it always starts it as the same 
</I>&gt;<i> user regardless of who it is pulling email for)
</I>
Should not influence that situation, except if you share the .fetchids
file between accounts - I don't know how you would manage to do that
though, because fetchmail records the login and target host along with
the UIDs.

&gt;<i> Is there a maximum number of lines that can be process in the .fetchids 
</I>&gt;<i> file?  (IE is this handled by an array that has an upper limit?)
</I>
No fixed limits, as long as it can allocate memory, no problem there.

&gt;<i> Our userbase is growing so I think that this should be growing too.  
</I>&gt;<i> Does the .fetchids file stay in sync with the external servers that it 
</I>&gt;<i> gets its information from? (IE If an email is removed from an external 
</I>&gt;<i> server, will fetchmail see that and remove the unique id from the 
</I>&gt;<i> .fetchids file?)
</I>
Yes, it will. Anything suspicious in the mail logs?
Notices, Warnings, Errors?

What kind of upstream server is fetchmail getting its mail from, might
that one goof up UIDs?

Best regards
