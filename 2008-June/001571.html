Are these extra copies or perhaps real intended copies? Check all headers,
if there is only one difference (except in the Received: header written by
fetchmail and those Received: headers that appear above fetchmail's), it's
not a copy.

&gt;<i>  I have been monitoring the .fetchids file and have noticed that it
</I>&gt;<i> will grow to just a little larger then 212000 bytes in size and then
</I>&gt;<i> shrinks back down again.
</I>&gt;<i>  Is there a maximum size that this file can be?
</I>
Usually what your operating system and hardware can handle - it is kept in
memory with a reasonable overhead per line; but no artificial limits are
imposed by fetchmail itself. It may also be that the server expires older
and/or downloaded messages after some time, and if the influx of mail over
time is roughly constant, that would explain why the file size also remains
sort of constant.

Check the computer's memory (memtest86+ for x86/amd64 computers) and fans
and heat sinks, and if very dusty, clean them.

(Note that there's an order of magnitude missing, 212000 are rather 0.2
than 2 Mb).
