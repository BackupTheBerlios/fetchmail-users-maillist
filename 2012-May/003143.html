</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I believe that I have finally got /etc/fetchmailrc correct but I cannot

</I>
You have configured multidrop, meaning that you may (that depends on
Demon's configuration that I do not know) receive mail for multiple
users in your sub-domain through the same mailbox.

Given the localdomains setting, fetchmail will take the local part of
the destination address and assume that the user exists locally.

Is that what you are doing?  Then you may need to add an &quot;envelope&quot;
option, on the provision that Demon retains the envelope destination
address.

For details, I'd either need to see their documentation (if available to
non-customers), or the unchanged headers as fetched from such an account.

&gt;<i> As part of the Demon 'upgrade' all e-mails get the mail headers rewritten
</I>&gt;<i> to <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/fetchmail-users">administrator at hostname.demon.co.uk</A> before being stored in Exchange. The
</I>&gt;<i> Demon FAQ suggests using their web forms to register any addresses that
</I>&gt;<i> you don't want rewritten which I have done. However, that still leaves
</I>&gt;<i> mailing lists broken.
</I>
What headers exactly are rewritten?

Is the original envelope retained in headers such as &quot;X-Delivered-To&quot;,
&quot;X-Original-To&quot;, &quot;Envelope-To:&quot; or similar?

Is the original envelope, if retained, rewritten to <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/fetchmail-users">administrator at ...</A> too?

&gt;<i> What I want to be able to do:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> is to take a 'failing' dlist e-mail and replay it through fetchmail to
</I>&gt;<i> prove that mail to lists will work with the new fetchmailrc file. I am
</I>&gt;<i> happy that the POP conversation has worked as all such e-mails end up
</I>&gt;<i> in /var/mail/fetchmail. What I want to test is that I have configured
</I>&gt;<i> /etc/fetchmailrc correctly.
</I>
Many mailing lists have an address that sends help texts back, and you
get that by sending a message with &quot;help&quot; in the subject (without the
quotes), and help as first and only line of the body to the -request
address, such as fetchmail-users-request at lists.berlios.de. (replace
the at).

&gt;<i> I have read the FAQ but cannot see a way to replay a message in order to
</I>&gt;<i> test configuration changes.
</I>
That is because fetchmail alone cannot achieve that, and I do not want
to encourage people to randomly try around and possibly send dozens of
test messages to the list post address when they goof up.

The only recourse is to generate such mail - possibly with an IMAP
client that just copies the message you want to test to your INBOX
folder, else by sending such a test mail. Some clients (mutt, or
Thunderbird with Add-Ons) can &quot;bounce&quot; instead of &quot;forward&quot; a message -
if you bounce that to those of your Demon addresses that will receive
list mail, it might get close enough.

Best
Matthias
