<PRE>It is a well-known fact that procmail is too demanding to configure
properly for the average user, and the documentation is insufficient in
this respect.

What have the procmail maintainers done in the past four years to remedy
this? Nothing. No documentation, no code changes, no new release.

With my system administrator hat on, I have taken procmail away from
my users and given them maildrop instead, years ago, and I think
fetchmail 6.3.0 should go this route, as suggested by Thomas Wolff.

To use procmail safely, you have to add something after every delivering
recipe, that either you or Philip posted to the postfix-users list ages
ago when I complained:

:<i>0e
</I>{
  EXITCODE=75
  HOST
}

This is cumbersome, unintuitive, in none of the prominent tutorials, and
ugly as sin. The ugliness at that time caused embarrassed silence...

To the user: use maildrop, it does The Right Thing[TM] out of the box,
namely exiting with EX_TEMPFAIL as per /usr/include/sysexits.h

What's worse, procmail shows many incomplete examples that confuse the
user.

This procmail fallthrough behavior that makes the many popular and
shipped (see procmailex!) examples so unusable that users have to start
chasing their mail in bad weather is what makes me support Thomas's
original suggestion in spite of the problem being his own fault.

The problem gets worse when multiple rules may match a message. In that
case, the order of matches makes a difference, and mail may end up in
the wrong box, when, for instance by a POP3 or IMAP server shuffling its
mailbox around, /var/mail is TEMPORARILY out of space - the first rule
matches, attempt FOR DELIVERY fails, the mail server lets go of the
temporary file of the other user, meanwhile procmail falls through, the
second rule matches and delivery succeeds -&gt; boom, the mail is in the
wrong destination.

Just unsetting DEFAULT/ORGMAIL as you suggest below is not sufficient to
fix this. It's also a long shot from being anywhere close to a solution.

&gt;<i> &gt; User feedback and documentation should be improved,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Please provide suggestions as to what wording in the logfile would have made
</I>&gt;<i> it more clear?
</I>
The logfile should be enabled by default, and right in the face of the
user: $HOME/procmail.log

&gt;<i> Same question for the manpage; in what way should we rephrase it?
</I>
The code must change, not the manual page. In order not to break
existing setups, you should make new &quot;EX_TEMPFAIL right away&quot; behavior a
compile-time switch that defaults to off, or you should make it a
feature that is so prominently documented it warrants a version bump to
procmail 4.

&gt;<i> &gt; though, and maybe
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; this case of redirection should not be applied at all
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Mail wants to arrive.  That means, if we can salvage the mail, instead of
</I>&gt;<i> bouncing it, then that is the preferred solution.  Rescueing instead of
</I>&gt;<i> giving up is the proper action.  It basically guards the user from his
</I>&gt;<i> own lack of knowledge on the situation (and since the user can't
</I>&gt;<i> be asked at that point, procmail has to make an intelligent decision).
</I>
procmail's undeterministic behavior is worse than a bounce.

A message that is delivered to the wrong place is a message lost for the
user, and at best one that causes additional work. Why use a filter at
all if it doesn't work?  procmail's &quot;intelligence&quot; is a disservice to
users. We've been through this before, and you fail to see the point.

Imagine someone filtering his important messages (from VIP, with special
subject) to a particular &quot;important&quot; mailbox, to see the mail early, and
only checks his default mailbox once in a while. He'll &quot;lose&quot; that
important mail and only find it later. Is *that* smart? No, it isn't.

maildrop takes care to exit with EX_TEMPFAIL unless there is a really
clear permanent problem (such as user not found in virtual setups). That
makes the message stay in the queue, and fetchmail will thus leave it on
the server and retry later, and that is what users expect.

&gt;<i> &gt; (or be configurable)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It is, just put the following lines anywhere in your .procmailrc file:
</I>&gt;<i>   DEFAULT
</I>&gt;<i>   ORGMAIL
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Which will unset the DEFAULT and ORGMAIL variables (and prevent
</I>&gt;<i> evasive action in case of system or user error).
</I>
As shown above, this does not work for any setups except perhaps (full
example) this trivial one:

DEFAULT
ORGMAIL

:<i>0:
</I>everything
