The message is illegally formatted (in this case, has no blank line
between headers and body) and should never have been accepted by 1&amp;1's
mail server (though from personal experience I'm not surprised). 
Fetchmail is doing the correct thing and discarding this email.

Previously it has been suggested that one option might be to wrap the
entire of the illegal mail and forward it to the postmaster.  Nobody
however was willing to put the effort into a patch to do this, and
frankly given that every occurence to date has been identified as spam
I'm not surprised.

I am however happy to see that the forthcoming 6.3.0 release will
handle this more gracefully than previous versions :)
