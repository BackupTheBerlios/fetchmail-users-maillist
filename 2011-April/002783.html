<PRE>M&gt;  All I'm saying is that the computer that fetchmail _gets_ its mail from
and the computer that fetchmail _forwards_ its mail to should have
different names, ...


     Mattias,
     Why do you think this?  This is contrary to what I have observed as 
a consultant.  I have several business customers that have this situation.

     The most common case is that the business has an unreliable, 
low-bandwidth Internet connection to their office (such as cablemodem, 
DSL, or cell phone), frequently with a dynamic IP address.  They want to 
run a Linux box to store mail, and to act as their primary mail server.  
But they also use an email service provider (like GMail), so that their 
customer emails don't bounce every time their crappy Comcast modem goes 
offline.  Or sometimes they don't have the technical expertise necessary 
to run a secure, low-spam email server with port 25 open to the public.  
Or maybe their ISP filters port 25 (like Comcast does), so they can't 
receive mail for their domain from the outside.

     I've also seen a growing mix of web-based applications that would 
be in this situation.  Consider an incident tracker (like Trac or 
Mantis) that accepts email for &quot;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/fetchmail-users">support at company.com</A>&quot;, and automatically 
generates tickets from that.  Often the easiest way to set those up is 
to have fetchmail pull the emails from a remote IMAP server and then 
feed it to localhost, so that the local MTA doesn't need to listen on 
anything but 127.0.0.1.  This is especially true of virtual machines, 
where a generic disk image (with a pre-built MTA config) can be deployed 
many times over on different IP addresses.  Scripting the creation of a 
two-line .fetchmailrc is far easier, cheaper, and more secure than 
finding a qualified mail admin to set up a unique Postfix configuration 
for each virtual machine (and then set up a new DNS record for it).  
It's not just incident trackers... it's also groupware, calendars, 
accounting systems, asset trackers, etc.

     I understand that, according to the SMTP protocols (and RFCs) two 
different computers should not both consider themselves the primary MX 
for a particular domain.  But fetchmail has been one of the best tools 
to work around that (broken) assumption.


Thanks,
Derek Simkowiak
