Hi Jerry,

glad to know you've got it working, and my thanks go out to everyone who
assisted Jerry.


As to the proposed manual page changes, I don't think these are specific
to plus addressing. Most are what I believe specifics of your setup, and
Rob's suggestion to use multidrop addressing with a wildcard is sufficient.

I take it that the manual page is more a reference than a walkthrough,
and I plan to enhance documentation for a future version -- but as that
is also going to make configuration different and hopefully easier, none
of that has been written yet.

As to the particular suggestions:

&quot;localdomains&quot; isn't the only option for such setups - and it is a bit
different from, for instance, &quot;aka&quot; -- which would serve others, too.

WRT &quot;dropdelivered&quot;, I don't think I am ready to advertise it for such
setups (possibly I should remove it from future fetchmail versions
altogether).  It seems that it is only needed if there are multiple
computers around with the same hostname (i. e. one upstream, possibly a
rented server, and your own personal home/SOHO Postfix or Exim host),
and I am certainly not going to support such setups as they are
error-prone and debugging them is long-winded (as evidenced by the
length of the thread).

I need to think about this a bit more, and comments are welcome.

Best regards
Matthias
