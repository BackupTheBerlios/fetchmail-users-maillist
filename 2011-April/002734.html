Not anything you could do from the fetchmail end currently.

fetchmail does not _delete_ retrieved mail if you use &quot;keep&quot;, but POP3
doesn't specify any interaction between retrieval through a POP3 client
and other presentation of the mail store through other clients (such as
IMAP clients).  Exchange is permitted to do what you observe.  Even
though fetchmail tries somewhat harder by using &quot;TOP&quot; rather than RETR -
there is no standard that would say &quot;leave message unmarked&quot;.

And even if there were, chances are that Microsoft would consider
noncompliance beneficial...

Using TOP rather than RETR, however, happens to work with a lot of servers.

Fetchmail 7 (which is ready when it's ready, and no sooner) will
eventually offer an option to not mark messages seen when using IMAP,
but all existing releases and Git branches explicitly mark mail
retrieved through IMAP as Seen.

And before you waste time on getmail, it can't do that either.
