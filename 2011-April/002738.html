<PRE>Sorry, it's been a while, and this has been lingering in my Drafts
folder.  I suppose I got distracted while writing it.  I'll still answer
even after four weeks.

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Thanks for your quick reply. I do concur with most of what you have
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> stated. One area in which I do not totally agree is the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;SSL/TLS-wrapped&quot; proposal. That protocol is deprecated. It usually
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> required port 465 I believe (I forget right now). Even Postfix does
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> not by default support that protocol; although, it obviously can be
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> made to use it. I believe that the only real user of that protocol
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> was MS Outlook &lt;=2002. All modern MUAs support TLS on port 587
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> which is also supported by RFCs. What I am trying to say is that I
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> would certainly not waste anytime on an obsolete/deprecated
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> protocol, especially one not supported by current RFCs. I would
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> first work on making Fetchmail fully TLS (STARTTLS) compliant
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> {Fetchmail 7} before working or wasting time on a dead protocol.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Well, I know that there is an ongoing effort to get rid of the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> SSL-wrapped service ports, but they are simply not going away just
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> because someone says so -- I postulate that established SSL-wrapped
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> services will be around for quite long and new ones will be rolled
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> out.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> SSL over 465 was never supported by any RFC as far as I know. It was
</I>&gt;<i> something Microsoft, and I believe Eudora concocted.
</I>
Possibly not by any RFC, but there was a time (long ago, in the late
1990s) when 465/tcp was officially registered (meaning through IANA, the
Internet Assigned Numbers Authority), following specifications in SSL
3.0, to be revoked later when STARTTLS was published.

&lt;<A HREF="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/security/pki/nss/ssl/draft302.txt">http://www.mozilla.org/projects/security/pki/nss/ssl/draft302.txt</A>&gt;
&lt;<A HREF="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/ietf-tls/1997JanMar/0023.html">http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/ietf-tls/1997JanMar/0023.html</A>&gt;

&gt;<i> While they may invariably be around for awhile, I would question as to
</I>&gt;<i> whether new ones would be rolled out. Even pathetic services like GMail
</I>
New sites and/or smtps/port 465 services have been rolled out since.

&gt;<i> which claim to support SSL on port 465 actually fully support STARTTLS
</I>&gt;<i> on 587. However, I will bow to your expertise. If someone wants to
</I>&gt;<i> implement a non RFC conforming mail system, I guess there is not much
</I>&gt;<i> that can be done about it. However, forcing Fetchmail to conform to the
</I>
And I don't think that offering passive (server-side) services on that
port would conflict anywhere.  It may be frowned upon, but one of the
the robustness principle clauses is &quot;be liberal in what you accept&quot; and
will keep that service alive for a while.

&gt;<i> lowest common denominator does not seem like an advantageous solution
</I>&gt;<i> either; although, probably an inevitable one.
</I>
The question is if I plan to stand in the way of a pragmatic solution
that is actually the easier one to implement.

How much exposure such a feature gets is a different question though:
the functional code isn't a lot to write, but exposing this in some form
of user interface (i. e. rcfile, command line) and documenting it is
also quite some effort. Some fetchmail features are only accessible
through environment variables.
&lt;<A HREF="http://www.fetchmail.info/fetchmail-man.html#51">http://www.fetchmail.info/fetchmail-man.html#51</A>&gt;

&gt;&gt;<i> The key argument for SSL-wrapped service (as opposed to STARTTLS) is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> simplicity in implementation, in that it does not require protocol
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> changes, unlike STARTTLS.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I fully agree to a point. Since new code must be written anyway, why
</I>&gt;<i> not start with the latest RFC compliant modes and then work on the
</I>&gt;<i> deprecated ones? It is my own belief, somewhat supported by surveys,
</I>&gt;<i> that obsoleted/deprecated protocols remain in effect simply because
</I>&gt;<i> users still support them. Once the support for them dries up, their use
</I>&gt;<i> evaporates. In this one respect I give Wietse Venema a lot of credit.
</I>
True enough.

&gt;<i> He has refused to make changes to Postfix simply because someone else
</I>&gt;<i> is &quot;doing it&quot; in most cases. In fact, he gets rather cranky when
</I>&gt;<i> someone suggests that he change his position. I know Postfix can be
</I>&gt;<i> configured to support SSL-wrapped; however, he has wisely turned that
</I>&gt;<i> off by default. In any case, it was a relic from when Postfix was first
</I>&gt;<i> written circa 1999 or there about.
</I>
Indeed, and it was long gone when TLS was merged into Postfix around
2004/Postfix 2.2, with a changed interface in 2.3.

&gt;&gt;<i> That the channel (data stream, usually TCP) gets shared between
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> plaintext and ciphered protocol data also exhibited its own host of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> problems in STARTTLS that SSL-wrapped implementations are usually
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> immune to, and requires precise synchronization. See
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &lt;<A HREF="http://www.postfix.org/CVE-2011-0411.html">http://www.postfix.org/CVE-2011-0411.html</A>&gt;.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I am fully aware of that notice. US-CERT issued an alert regarding it a
</I>&gt;<i> few days ago. You might be interested in this URL if you have not all
</I>&gt;<i> ready perused it: <A HREF="http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/555316;">http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/555316;</A> however, to
</I>&gt;<i> delay the implementation of true TLS due to a flaw that was only
</I>&gt;<i> discovered within the last month or so and has absolutely no proof that
</I>&gt;<i> it was in fact ever actually implemented seems like a rather weak
</I>&gt;<i> excuse to me. 
</I>
I'm not trying to excuse anything but stating that there are valid
reasons to also implement SSL-wrapped SMTP even if not backed by
standards and why I expect it's not going away -- and that STARTTLS
isn't as trivial as it may seem either.

&gt;<i> In any case, it appears that &quot;openssl&quot; might implement
</I>&gt;<i> the one line change in the code to prevent this problem to begin with.
</I>
For as long as the server will be using an up to date OpenSSL version, yes.

&gt;<i> if those ISPs or whatever were to start being blitzed with complaints
</I>&gt;<i> from their users about not supporting modern protocols a change in
</I>&gt;<i> their infrastructure might ensue. Then again, that is my own opinion. I
</I>
Depends on if the support inquiries are actually escalated to tech
staff, and if they bought licenses for commercial server software that
actually speaks those protocols.

&gt;<i> In any event and to save yourself a lot of grief from unhappy users, I
</I>&gt;<i> would STRONGLY recommend that you put a disclaimer in the man pages,
</I>&gt;<i> perhaps elsewhere also, that SSL-wrapped in not on by default in
</I>&gt;<i> Postfix and certain other MTAs. If the user is going to go that route
</I>&gt;<i> they must be made aware of this fact or else you will inevitably be
</I>&gt;<i> getting a barrage of complaints from users wanting to know why they are
</I>&gt;<i> having connection problems.
</I>
My current idea is to support some limited kind of autoprobing all ports
with a timeout, and the first secure one get the award of the connection.

&gt;<i> By the way, do you have any idea when a release candidate for
</I>&gt;<i> Fetchmail 7 might be available? I am assuming it is a year or so away. I
</I>&gt;<i> would be happy to do some beta testing on it. I am getting ready to set
</I>&gt;<i> up a PC devoted to testing beta products right now.
</I>
No guess or promise at all because fetchmail is a spare-time project.

If someone (or possibly company) wants to upgrade my fetchmail
priorities for part time, contact me off-list on short notice.

The Git repository is public, and the future version is on the &quot;next&quot;
branch but I'd consider it alpha state, and configure.ac identifies it
as such. See &lt;<A HREF="http://gitorious.org/fetchmail/fetchmail">http://gitorious.org/fetchmail/fetchmail</A>&gt; - however apart
from a few cleanups (&quot;remove support for obsolete protocols or systems&quot;)
and a speed-up of the UIDL code contributed by Rainer Weikusat with kind
permission of his employer, not much has happened, again, due to
real-life obligations :)
