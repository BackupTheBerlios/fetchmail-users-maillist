</I>&gt;<i> first, but it still failed without the &quot;localdomains&quot; being

</I>&gt;<i> hostname for the machine it is running on and always consider that
</I>&gt;<i> local unless overridden by some other flag; ie, &quot;--nolocalhost&quot; or
</I>&gt;<i> something like that. The option to add additional localhosts should
</I>&gt;<i> still remain though. I am just playing around here, sorry.
</I>
Which is perfectly fine since I've asked for such comments - and some
kind of kicking things around might put these things into a different
light and kindle new ideas.

Recovering from family vacation and preparation over Easter holidays, I
haven't looked at every tiny bit yet.  Anyways I do agree that the
aka/localdomains and multidrop stuff is hard to understand from the
manual page and there isn't a guide as to how to usefully set things up.

&gt;&gt;<i> They were looping because the Postfix you're injecting to listens to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the same names than the server you're fetching from - both think they
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> are &quot;seibercom.net&quot;. Oops.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> IMNSHO, nobody should ever need &quot;dropdelivered&quot;, as that is a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> dangerous cure for the symptom, but does not remedy the cause.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I had created an experimental site on Google apps that resembled the
</I>&gt;<i> actual environment that I was attempting to set fetchmail up to work
</I>&gt;<i> in. In both case, the actual one and the experimental one, the domain
</I>&gt;<i> name on Google apps mirrored the hostname on the mailserver. There are
</I>
Whatever Google Apps provides exactly, this setup with mirrored
hostnames is what mail systems aren't made for.

All I'm saying is that the computer that fetchmail _gets_ its mail from
and the computer that fetchmail _forwards_ its mail to should have
different names, and then neither software would be getting in your way.

&gt;<i> probably more similar setups, although I cannot confirm that. In any
</I>&gt;<i> case, removing that option would cause Postfix to always reject such
</I>&gt;<i> e-mails. Removing that option would make configuration, IMHO, more
</I>&gt;<i> difficult. Although I am all in favor of improvement and development of
</I>&gt;<i> better ideas and concepts, I believe the axiomatic, &quot;If it ain't broke,
</I>&gt;<i> don't fix it&quot; is apropos here.
</I>
I usually subscribe to that saying, but I'm also trying to prevent
accidents and guide users to more robust setups -- and I certainly do
not need code that needs maintenance, care, testing, and everything if I
can solve that same problem with documentation (such as a &quot;don't use the
same hostname for your mail source and sink computers&quot; rule).

Not convinced yet :-)
