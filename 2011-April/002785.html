Derek,

I think that because the hostnames need not be the same as the mail
domain names, at least not if Postfix or Exim are used.

&gt;<i>     The most common case is that the business has an unreliable,
</I>&gt;<i> low-bandwidth Internet connection to their office (such as cablemodem,
</I>&gt;<i> DSL, or cell phone), frequently with a dynamic IP address.  They want to
</I>&gt;<i> run a Linux box to store mail, and to act as their primary mail server. 
</I>&gt;<i> But they also use an email service provider (like GMail), so that their
</I>&gt;<i> customer emails don't bounce every time their crappy Comcast modem goes
</I>&gt;<i> offline.
</I>
While I understand and support use of external MXes or backup MXes in
that case, no mail should bounce at the sender's SMTP site due to a
network outage for the MX, unless the links goes down for a couple of
days in a row.  Possibly you get &quot;still being retried, do not resend
yet&quot; notifications.  SMTP retry policies should take care of delivery.

&gt;<i> Or sometimes they don't have the technical expertise necessary
</I>&gt;<i> to run a secure, low-spam email server with port 25 open to the public. 
</I>&gt;<i> Or maybe their ISP filters port 25 (like Comcast does), so they can't
</I>&gt;<i> receive mail for their domain from the outside.
</I>
That still doesn't explain why they need to have the same domain names
in Delivered-To: headers of the upstream mail provider (the one
fetchmail talks POP3/IMAP to) and their own downstream Postfix or Exim
box (that fetchmail talks SMTP/LMTP to), which is what the discussion is
about.

&gt;<i>     I've also seen a growing mix of web-based applications that would be
</I>&gt;<i> in this situation.  Consider an incident tracker (like Trac or Mantis)
</I>&gt;<i> that accepts email for &quot;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/fetchmail-users">support at company.com</A>&quot;, and automatically
</I>&gt;<i> generates tickets from that.  Often the easiest way to set those up is
</I>&gt;<i> to have fetchmail pull the emails from a remote IMAP server and then
</I>&gt;<i> feed it to localhost, so that the local MTA doesn't need to listen on
</I>&gt;<i> anything but 127.0.0.1.  This is especially true of virtual machines,
</I>&gt;<i> where a generic disk image (with a pre-built MTA config) can be deployed
</I>&gt;<i> many times over on different IP addresses.  Scripting the creation of a
</I>&gt;<i> two-line .fetchmailrc is far easier, cheaper, and more secure than
</I>&gt;<i> finding a qualified mail admin to set up a unique Postfix configuration
</I>&gt;<i> for each virtual machine (and then set up a new DNS record for it). 
</I>
Yes indeed - still the VM won't have the same IP as other IPs, and can
just as easily use a different hostname. Enter DHCP, for instance. :)
The automatically assigned hostname doesn't get in the way of accepting
mail for, say, <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/fetchmail-users">support at example.com.</A>

And you do want different hostnames in the logs and Received: headers,
too, lest debugging become a major search operation.

&gt;<i> It's not just incident trackers... it's also groupware, calendars,
</I>&gt;<i> accounting systems, asset trackers, etc.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     I understand that, according to the SMTP protocols (and RFCs) two
</I>&gt;<i> different computers should not both consider themselves the primary MX
</I>&gt;<i> for a particular domain.  But fetchmail has been one of the best tools
</I>&gt;<i> to work around that (broken) assumption.
</I>
That isn't my point, and the downstream computer wouldn't be
usually be an MX at all in the unreliable-Internet SOHO case you
outlined first.  Two computers being the primary MX is perfectly safe,
but they should not share the actual internal hostname even though they
handle the same domains, possibly to a set of IMAP servers running off
some NAS or SAN or some other load-balancing rig.

And using separate hostnames should take care of that.

If we find we still need some kind of delivered-to: handling then surely
dropping the header isn't right, but a particular rewriting scheme
should be applied that leaves the loop jamming property of Delivered-To:
intact.  I've more often than not seen people set up forwarding loops,
and as many of the unsuitable procmail examples you find with Google or
Bing or Yahoo eliminate a great deal of headers, we need to jam loops in
as many places as possible.

I don't plan to remove essential functionality, but I don't want to keep
around the most dangerous approach either.

What do you think?

Best regards,
Matthias
