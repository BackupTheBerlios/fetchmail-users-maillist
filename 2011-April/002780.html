</I>&gt;<i> Hi Jerry,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> glad to know you've got it working, and my thanks go out to everyone
</I>&gt;<i> who assisted Jerry.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As to the proposed manual page changes, I don't think these are
</I>&gt;<i> specific to plus addressing. Most are what I believe specifics of
</I>&gt;<i> your setup, and Rob's suggestion to use multidrop addressing with a

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I take it that the manual page is more a reference than a walkthrough,
</I>&gt;<i> and I plan to enhance documentation for a future version -- but as
</I>&gt;<i> that is also going to make configuration different and hopefully
</I>&gt;<i> easier, none of that has been written yet.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As to the particular suggestions:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;localdomains&quot; isn't the only option for such setups - and it is a bit
</I>&gt;<i> different from, for instance, &quot;aka&quot; -- which would serve others, too.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> WRT &quot;dropdelivered&quot;, I don't think I am ready to advertise it for such
</I>&gt;<i> setups (possibly I should remove it from future fetchmail versions
</I>&gt;<i> altogether).  It seems that it is only needed if there are multiple
</I>&gt;<i> computers around with the same hostname (i. e. one upstream, possibly
</I>&gt;<i> a rented server, and your own personal home/SOHO Postfix or Exim
</I>&gt;<i> host), and I am certainly not going to support such setups as they are
</I>&gt;<i> error-prone and debugging them is long-winded (as evidenced by the
</I>&gt;<i> length of the thread).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I need to think about this a bit more, and comments are welcome.
</I>
I think you really should reconsider not dropping &quot;dropdelivered&quot; from
future versions of Fetchmail. By the way, I did try the &quot;aka&quot; option
first, but it still failed without the &quot;localdomains&quot; being
specifically entered. An option might be for Fetchmail to get the
hostname for the machine it is running on and always consider that
local unless overridden by some other flag; ie, &quot;--nolocalhost&quot; or
something like that. The option to add additional localhosts should
still remain though. I am just playing around here, sorry.

&gt;<i> They were looping because the Postfix you're injecting to listens to
</I>&gt;<i> the same names than the server you're fetching from - both think they
</I>&gt;<i> are &quot;seibercom.net&quot;. Oops.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> IMNSHO, nobody should ever need &quot;dropdelivered&quot;, as that is a
</I>&gt;<i> dangerous cure for the symptom, but does not remedy the cause.
</I>
I had created an experimental site on Google apps that resembled the
actual environment that I was attempting to set fetchmail up to work
in. In both case, the actual one and the experimental one, the domain
name on Google apps mirrored the hostname on the mailserver. There are
probably more similar setups, although I cannot confirm that. In any
case, removing that option would cause Postfix to always reject such
e-mails. Removing that option would make configuration, IMHO, more
difficult. Although I am all in favor of improvement and development of
better ideas and concepts, I believe the axiomatic, &quot;If it ain't broke,
don't fix it&quot; is apropos here.

Just my 2&#162; worth of input.
