<PRE>I've been using fetchmail 6.2.5+NTLM+SSL to retrieve mail from the
corporate Exchange :( server, and it has been working well :)

Recently, the server was &quot;upgraded&quot; -- to something like Exchange
2002 from Exchange 5.5 IIRC -- and I started having trouble with
message format.  I doubt very much that it is a fetchmail problem,
but am hoping that someone in the community may have seen something
similar and know a solution.  The prospect of getting the server
admins to change a configuration setting would be improved if they
did not have to research what setting to change :)

Before the upgrade, mail sent as plain text (with no Content-Type:,
Content-Transfer-Encoding: etc.) would be passed through as sent.
Since the upgrade, it looks as if Exchange is rewriting the body of
such messages as quoted-printable, and inserting several headers:

  MIME-Version: 1.0
  Content-Type: text/plain;
          charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;
  Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable
  Content-class: urn:content-classes:message
  X-MimeOLE: Produced By Microsoft Exchange V6.5.7226.0
  X-MS-Has-Attach: 
  X-MS-TNEF-Correlator: 
  Thread-Topic: &lt;same as Subject: header&gt;
  Thread-Index: &lt;string of gibberish&gt;

The extra headers aren't really a problem, but does anyone know a
way to keep the server from &quot;helping&quot; with the message encoding?
Granted the correct solution would be to ditch Exchange altogether,
but that is not currently an option :(

BTW this is an improvement from what happened at first:  initially
it was converting things to multipart, with both a text/plain and
a text/html part (both encoded as quoted-printable), and I think
it may have been doing it to outgoing messages as well as incoming.
They did figure out how to turn that off after a few days.
