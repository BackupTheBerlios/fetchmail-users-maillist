&gt;<i> Hello,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It&#8217;s my first message here so here is a little introduction. I&#8217;m a system administrator, software developer and certified trainer specialized on Apple product (OS X, OS X Server, iOS&#8230;). I&#8217;ve run many OS X Server with fetchmail as a &#171; POP Connector &#187; to extract e-mail from external e-mail server and store them on the OS X Server e-mail server (postfix / dovecot).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That work for a while now, without any problems, with many fetchmail version on many OS X Server version.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> But since a month, I&#8217;ve a problem with many of my server with no common points. Fetchmail stop to work complaining about DNS issues :
</I>&gt;<i> fetchmail: Query status=11 (DNS)
</I>&gt;<i> fetchmail: couldn't find canonical DNS name of mail.gandi.net (mail.gandi.net): nodename nor servname provided, or not known
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If I restart my fetchmail daemon, it&#8217;s like a charm for many hours and still break down after a random duration.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I run fetchmail from a custom launchd script (the init.d equivalent on OS X Server) who basically do that:
</I>&gt;<i> /usr/local/bin/fetchmail -L /var/log/fetchmail.log -f /etc/fetchmailrc
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I&#8217;ve read on your FAQ that you need log dump from connection, but I&#8217;m not gonna share that on a public mailing list. E-mail address of my clients are confidential and it&#8217;s not the first connection who is problematic. It&#8217;s only after few hours or days some time.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So, anyone have an idea about how troubleshoot that?
</I>
The error message stems from driver.c, and tells you that getaddrinfo()
failed, and decodes the error code it returned.  This getaddrinfo() is
called if the dns option is in effect (which it is by default) to obtain
the canonical hostname (through AI_CANONNAME flag).  I don't see how
that would start failing randomly out of the blue.


If your fetchmail version is older (a relevant bug was fixed in 6.3.6,
over 6 years ago), upgrade all the way to 6.3.26.


If the trouble started when you have installed system upgrades on OS X
server, for instance, if you have installed a newer BIND (named)
version, that might be the culprit.  Please verify if other applications
on the same computers that use the system's resolver have DNS trouble
(Postfix does not count).


If you do not rely on fetchmail's MX lookups for multidrop
configurations, switch them off with &quot;no dns&quot; in the failing
configurations, or in a &quot;defaults&quot; section. Then, add mail server alias
names with &quot;aka&quot; where required.  Note that this does not solve the
problem, but merely side steps it, and it changes fetchmail's behaviour.


Read the manual page under &quot;Singledrop vs. Multidrop options&quot; on the dns
and aka options to see what they do, before you change them.



I can currently look up mail.gandi.net., it returns 1 IPv4 and 1 IPv6
address record for me:

mail.gandi.net has address 217.70.184.11
mail.gandi.net has IPv6 address 2001:4b98:c:521::11


If that all does not help, you will have to provide the &quot;defaults&quot; and
&quot;poll&quot; configurations for the failing server (you can replace the
username, but not the domain - we need to look at original data for DNS
debugging) and state more system details (fetchmail version, MacOS X
version, and so on).
