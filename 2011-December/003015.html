Well, the &quot;IDLE&quot; feature in particular is an odd one, in that it does
not blend in with fetchmail's model of operation, has many quirks, and
took many a fix to get going to the point where it is.  I don't believe
IDLE has much of a future with the current fetchmail model, but I am
open for event-based (one thread holding several file descriptors, which
is prone to unveiling kernel bugs all about) or multithreaded approaches
(which is prone to unveiling library issues...), as well as more
versatile successors of IDLE, although I do not yet know how
widely-supported that is on the server side, and which way I'll go with
future versions.

The one thing I can offer is that people can create
one-rcfile-per-server and use the FETCHMAILHOME environment variable to
run multiple instances of fetchmail that can idle, without getting in
one another's way, but that doesn't bring you anywhere closer to UID
support for IMAP in fetchmail unfortunately.

Best regards,
Matthias
