<PRE>&gt;<i> In my testing, I've noticed a pattern where the error occurs and it is
</I>&gt;<i> repeatable, even from the command line.  But once I execute the openssl
</I>&gt;<i> command as above, that seems to uncork the system for a period of time,
</I>&gt;<i> thought not permanently as it does recur.  One thing I did note is that
</I>&gt;<i> when everything works, the server common name is seen as
</I>&gt;<i> *.pop.mail.yahoo.com, whereas when it doesn't the common name is as
</I>&gt;<i> pop.mail.yahoo.com.

Hi Gerry,

sorry to hear you're having issues, and thank you for taking the time to  
report the issue and produce the required logs.

At first glance this appears mysterious, because I don't know how openssl  
could &quot;uncork&quot;. Yahoo appear to do load balancing across several levels,  
meaning that there are several servers that you access by the same name,  
and behind that again different servers accessed through the same external  
IP.

Apparently not all have the same certificate.

The observation around the common names (which are part of the  
certificate) is key to understanding the issue, and suggest that some of  
the Yahoo servers in the load balanced server pool are misconfigured, or  
that their load balancing setup has been changed but not all DNS changes  
have propagated through caching DNS servers (although that is rather  
unlikely, Yahoo set a DNS timeout of 5 minutes here for the Plus POP  
servers).

An explanation why openssl uncorks things would be that there are sort of  
two or three faulty servers you get &quot;drawn&quot;, and if you run openssl a  
couple of times, the balancer front-end has skipped over the faulty ones  
and next time fetchmail gets an intact again.

I'd suggest revisiting the Yahoo website for configuration instructions of  
the POP (perhaps your setup is old and Yahoo wants you to change it);  
however if your configuration is correct, I'd suggest reporting this to  
Yahoo. Be sure to mention the host names that are broken, from the  
greeting lines logged, for instance this:

+OK hello from popgate 2.45.2 on pop108.plus.mail.ac4.yahoo.com

You may need to remove &quot;--sslcertck&quot; to actually get fetchmail that far  
(hadn't checked if you have it set).

Best regards
