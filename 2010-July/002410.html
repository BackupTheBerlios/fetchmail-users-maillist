Alright, I had to go back and check the &quot;sslcertck&quot; option definition.
I've had that one set from the start.  For some reason, I got it in my
head that it forced the strict comparison of the common name, but I now
see that I misread/misunderstood the definition.

As for the rest, yes I understand that fetchmail isn't going to
continuously retry upon certificate failure.

I've just started using the sslfingerprint (as a result of this
experience, actually) option and, since the original problem settled
down, I've yet to see any errors related to invalid fingerprints.  I'm
surprised to learn that a POP provider would issue different
certificates with different fingerprints.  Even though there might be
multiple IP's behind it, there's still only 1 &quot;plus.pop.mail.yahoo.com&quot;,
right?  I figured a fingerprint error would alert me, at the best, to a
new certificate so that I might take the time to verify it myself.
Obviously, at the worst, a MITM attack, but at least I'd have a heads
up.  

I verified the certificate by comparing the results from here:
<A HREF="http://www.digicert.com/help/.">http://www.digicert.com/help/.</A>  

with results from the openssl command.  I figured the above URL would
use sufficiently different routing to get to the Yahoo servers that if I
WAS seeing a MITM, I would get different results.  Perhaps I'm being naive
though.  I did look for a Yahoo page listing the fingerprints, but was
unsuccessful.

Again, thanks for the comments. 

Regards-
Gerry LaMontagne
