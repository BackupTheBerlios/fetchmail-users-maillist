They can share (copy) the certificate across all servers, or they can use  
an individual one. You don't usually care because clients are supposed to  
use the certificate's signature chain back to a trusted root signer, to  
establish validity -- and not fingerprints.

Usually the certificate authority (CA) certificates (the ones that you  
need to install into .../ssl/certs and that are trusted if you put them  
there) are issued for 5 or 10 years, and the CA can re-issue server  
certificates. These are often issued for 0.5 - 3 years only and frequently  
changed. Each time, the fingerprint will change, but the same root CA  
configuration can establish validity for the new certificate.

&gt;<i> Obviously, at the worst, a MITM attack, but at least I'd have a heads
</I>&gt;<i> up.
</I>
Yup.

&gt;<i> I verified the certificate by comparing the results from here:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.digicert.com/help/.">http://www.digicert.com/help/.</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> with results from the openssl command.  I figured the above URL would
</I>&gt;<i> use sufficiently different routing to get to the Yahoo servers that if I
</I>&gt;<i> WAS seeing a MITM, I would get different results.  Perhaps I'm being  
</I>&gt;<i> naive though.  I did look for a Yahoo page listing the fingerprints, but  
</I>&gt;<i> was
</I>&gt;<i> unsuccessful.
</I>
It's untypical. You'd usually only find fingerprints for root certificates  
- but it's Equifax, not Yahoo, who holds the root certificate.
