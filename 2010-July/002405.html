Matthias-

Thanks for the reply and your explanation.  I've done quite a bit of
investigating since my email and I've come to similar conclusions so
it's good to get some independent verification.

I did revisit Yahoo for configuration information and my setup is still
the recommended one.  That had been a hope of mine early on.  Would have
made for an easy fix.

At this point, the errors have all but stopped.  So I think the upshot
is that maintenance was being done, and it took some time for everything
to settle out.  I agree that their load balancing during the maintenance
was misconfigured as I took some time to investigate the certificates
from &quot;plus&quot; and from &quot;pop&quot;.  Both have been valid for a couple years,
and the one from &quot;pop&quot; doesn't expire until November.  Indicating, to me
anyway, that they errantly thought the two server pools were compatible.
At this point, seeing that the errors have all but stopped, I'm not sure
reporting the problems will bring any joy.

FWIW- I did have --sslcertck enabled.  Based on my understanding from
the man page, I don't think I would have seen this problem without it?
I've also added the --sslfingerprint option to my rc file.  I believe this
should alert me to certificate changes in the future and allow me to
attempt to verify them on my own at that point.

Again, I think it's safe to conclude no problems with fetchmail and I'm
considering it case closed.

Regards-
Gerry LaMontagne
