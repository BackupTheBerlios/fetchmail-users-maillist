I've figured that mailfilter appears to run from preconnect.

&gt;<i> One of the mail servers I have a lifetime access to is running qmail, and 
</I>&gt;<i> it will occasionally cause mailfilter to output a usually bogus bad 
</I>&gt;<i> timestamp error and bail out, returning a -1 which causes fetchmail to 
</I>&gt;<i> report a syntax error and skip the fetch.  
</I>
&quot;      The  'preconnect'  keyword  allows you to specify a shell command
       to be executed just before each time fetchmail establishes
       a mailserver  con&#8208; nection.  This may be useful if you
       are attempting to set up secure POP connections with the aid
       of ssh(1).  If the command returns  a  nonzero status, the poll
       of that mailserver will be aborted.&quot;

Well, the /syntax/ error can and probably should be changed to something
else, particularly PS_ERROR, which isn't an exact match either but at
least not that misleading, if other users see a value in that.  The
behaviour &quot;report error and skip the poll&quot;, however, will need to remain
the same, and I will not change the interface in a 6.X release.

I've put this in my TODO-for-7.0 list, and may change the error code for
that release.

&gt;<i> If mailfilter is launched with the -r option on the cli, it returns the 
</I>&gt;<i> number of good msgs to pull.  Seems rather handy.
</I>
Useless in fetchmail's context if used uncooked.

&gt;<i> However, any non-zero return seems to be interpreted by fetchmail, freshly 
</I>&gt;<i> downloaded and built 3 days back, as a failure.
</I>
Exactly as advertised.

&gt;<i> It should, IMO treat any zero _or_ _positive_ _value_ as success.
</I>
What it should do is to preserve existing interfaces and not randomly
change that, because changing an interface will earn us nothing but a
truckload full of ifs and buts in the documentation, and angry users
because they need to rework their scripts.

I'd prefer to keep it the way it is, which is simple:
preconnect fails -&gt; poll skipped with error.

&gt;<i> So, in order to stop hammering the servers by doing a double poll but 
</I>&gt;<i> without the preconnect option the 2nd time, I have had to write wrapper 
</I>&gt;<i> scripts that gobble up mailfilters return value so that the defective msgs 
</I>&gt;<i> is pulled, otherwise that server never gets the bad msg pulled.  This is 
</I>&gt;<i> true even if I remove the -r from the mailfilter invocation wrapper.
</I>
Exactly what I would have suggested.
You've already solved it with the wrapper script.

&gt;<i> Can this be fixed in a subsequent fetchmail release?
</I>
I don't see anything to &quot;fix&quot; here, and I'm loathe to make such a
change, for the given reasons.

I understand this may be disappointing for you, but please understand
that the drawbacks for the many, to me, outweigh the needs of the few
(who appear to be quite capable of helping themselves to the solution).

Best regards,
Matthias
