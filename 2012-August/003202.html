</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I also use mailfilter-0.8.2 in my attempts to control the spam that

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I've figured that mailfilter appears to run from preconnect.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; One of the mail servers I have a lifetime access to is running qmail,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and it will occasionally cause mailfilter to output a usually bogus
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; bad timestamp error and bail out, returning a -1 which causes
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; fetchmail to report a syntax error and skip the fetch.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;      The  'preconnect'  keyword  allows you to specify a shell command
</I>&gt;<i>        to be executed just before each time fetchmail establishes
</I>&gt;<i>        a mailserver  con&#226;&#8364;&#1711; nection.  This may be useful if you
</I>&gt;<i>        are attempting to set up secure POP connections with the aid
</I>&gt;<i>        of ssh(1).  If the command returns  a  nonzero status, the poll
</I>&gt;<i>        of that mailserver will be aborted.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Well, the /syntax/ error can and probably should be changed to something
</I>&gt;<i> else, particularly PS_ERROR, which isn't an exact match either but at
</I>&gt;<i> least not that misleading, if other users see a value in that.  The
</I>&gt;<i> behaviour &quot;report error and skip the poll&quot;, however, will need to remain
</I>&gt;<i> the same, and I will not change the interface in a 6.X release.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I've put this in my TODO-for-7.0 list, and may change the error code for
</I>&gt;<i> that release.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; If mailfilter is launched with the -r option on the cli, it returns
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the number of good msgs to pull.  Seems rather handy.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Useless in fetchmail's context if used uncooked.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; However, any non-zero return seems to be interpreted by fetchmail,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; freshly downloaded and built 3 days back, as a failure.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Exactly as advertised.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; It should, IMO treat any zero _or_ _positive_ _value_ as success.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What it should do is to preserve existing interfaces and not randomly
</I>&gt;<i> change that, because changing an interface will earn us nothing but a
</I>&gt;<i> truckload full of ifs and buts in the documentation, and angry users
</I>&gt;<i> because they need to rework their scripts.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'd prefer to keep it the way it is, which is simple:
</I>&gt;<i> preconnect fails -&gt; poll skipped with error.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; So, in order to stop hammering the servers by doing a double poll but
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; without the preconnect option the 2nd time, I have had to write
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; wrapper scripts that gobble up mailfilters return value so that the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; defective msgs is pulled, otherwise that server never gets the bad
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; msg pulled.  This is true even if I remove the -r from the mailfilter
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; invocation wrapper.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Exactly what I would have suggested.
</I>&gt;<i> You've already solved it with the wrapper script.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Can this be fixed in a subsequent fetchmail release?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I don't see anything to &quot;fix&quot; here, and I'm loathe to make such a
</I>&gt;<i> change, for the given reasons.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I understand this may be disappointing for you, but please understand
</I>&gt;<i> that the drawbacks for the many, to me, outweigh the needs of the few
</I>&gt;<i> (who appear to be quite capable of helping themselves to the solution).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Best regards,
</I>&gt;<i> Matthias
</I>
;-)  About what I expected Matthias, and I can't argue with your reasons, 
precisely because the in use fetchmail ranks are a rather formidable 
number.

Fact is, that to make it work, for me at least, is to gobble up any error 
mailfilter returns &amp; send back a zero no matter what, so fetchmail will 
then go ahead and blindly pull the duff msg, which doesn't bother fetchmail 
a bit.  My wrapper does that.  As you say, problem solved AFAIK.  If it 
does re-appear, I'll come back out of hiding.  Thanks.

Cheers, Gene
