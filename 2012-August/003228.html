fetchmail-6.3.22 (released 2012-08-29, 26077 LoC):

# SECURITY FIXES
* for CVE-2012-3482:
  NTLM: fetchmail mistook an error message that the server sent in response to
  an NTLM request for protocol exchange, tried to decode it, and crashed while
  reading from a bad memory location.
  Also, with a carefully crafted NTLM challenge packet sent from the server, it
  would be possible that fetchmail conveyed confidential data not meant for the
  server through the NTLM response packet.
  Fix: Detect base64 decoding errors, validate the NTLM challenge, and abort
  NTLM authentication in case of error.
  See fetchmail-SA-2012-02.txt for further details.
  Reported by J. Porter Clark.

* for CVE-2011-3389:
  SSL/TLS (wrapped and STARTTLS): fetchmail used to disable a countermeasure 
  against a certain kind of attack against cipher block chaining initialization 
  vectors (SSL_OP_DONT_INSERT_EMPTY_FRAGMENTS).
  Whether this creates an exploitable situation, depends on the server and the 
  negotiated ciphers.
  As a precaution, fetchmail 6.3.22 enables the countermeasure, by clearing 
  SSL_OP_DONT_INSERT_EMPTY_FRAGMENTS.

  NOTE that this can cause connections to certain non-conforming servers to 
  fail, in which case you can set the environment variable 
  FETCHMAIL_DISABLE_CBC_IV_COUNTERMEASURE to any non-empty value when starting
  fetchmail to re-instate the compatibility option at the expense of security.

  Reported by Apple Product Security.

  For technical details, refer to &lt;<A HREF="http://www.openssl.org/~bodo/tls-cbc.txt">http://www.openssl.org/~bodo/tls-cbc.txt</A>&gt;.
  See fetchmail-SA-2012-01.txt for further details.

# BUG FIX
* The Server certificate: message in verbose mode now appears on stdout like the
  remainder of the output. Reported by Henry Jensen, to fix Debian Bug #639807.

* The GSSAPI-related autoconf code now matches gssapi.c better, and uses
  a different check to look for GSS_C_NT_HOSTBASED_SERVICE.
  This fixes the GSSAPI-enabled build on NetBSD 6 Beta.

# CHANGES
* On systems where SSLv2_client_method isn't defined in OpenSSL (such as
  newer Debian, and Ubuntu starting with 11.10 oneiric ocelot), don't
  reference it (to fix the build) and if configured, print a run-time error 
  that the OS does not support SSLv2. Fixes Debian Bug #622054, 
  but note that that bug report has a more thorough patch that does away with
  SSLv2 altogether.

* The security and errata notices fetchmail-{EN,SA}-20??-??.txt are now
  under the more relaxed CC BY-ND 3.0 license (the noncommercial clause
  was dropped). The Creative Commons address was updated.

* The Python-related Makefile.am parts were simplified to avoid an automake
  1.11.X bug around noinst_PYTHON, Automake Bug #10995.

* Configuring fetchmail without SSL now triggers a configure warning,
  and asks the user to consider running configure --with-ssl.

# WORKAROUND
* Some servers, notably Zimbra, return A1234 987 FETCH () in response to
  a header request, in the face of message corruption.  fetchmail now treats
  these as temporary errors. Report and Patch by Mikulas Patocka, Red Hat.

* Some servers, notably Microsoft Exchange, return &quot;A0009 OK FETCH completed.&quot;
  without any header in response to a header request for meeting reminder
  messages (with a &quot;meeting.ics&quot; attachment). fetchmail now treats these as
  transient errors.  Report by John Connett, Patch by Sunil Shetye.

# KNOWN BUGS AND WORKAROUNDS
  (This section floats upwards through the NEWS file so it stays with the
  current release information)
* Fetchmail does not handle messages without Message-ID header well
  (See sourceforge.net bug #780933)
* BSMTP is mostly untested and errors can cause corrupt output.
* Sun Workshop 6 (SPARC) is known to miscompile the configuration file lexer in
  64-bit mode.  Either compile 32-bit code or use GCC to compile 64-bit
  fetchmail.  Note that fetchmail doesn't take advantage of 64-bit code,
  so compiling 32-bit SPARC code should not cause any difficulties.
* Fetchmail does not track pending deletes across crashes.
* The command line interface is sometimes a bit stubborn, for instance,
  fetchmail -s doesn't work with a daemon running.
* Linux systems may return duplicates of an IP address in some circumstances if
  no or no global IPv6 addresses are configured.
  (No workaround. Ubuntu Bug#582585, Novell Bug#606980.)
* Kerberos 5 may be broken, particularly on Heimdal, and provide bogus error
  messages. This will not be fixed, because the maintainer has no Kerberos 5
  server to test against. Use GSSAPI.
