Note that I have had to make further changes in order to validate the
challenge even more thoroughly.  They are unneeded as long as the server
is trustworthy (or at least assumed not to be malicious), but 6.3.22
will have a more thorough fix against forged replies.

&gt;<i> So, it doesn't segfault, but on the other hand, it fails to authenticate.  I

</I>&gt;<i> (Otherwise, how was I able to get mail?)  But perhaps, as a result of the
</I>&gt;<i> server upgrade, NTLM authentication doesn't work anymore.  If so, then the
</I>&gt;<i> behavior above is correct.
</I>
Possibly.  Some things are conceivable as reason, and possibly one is
that you need to specify the domain (often called a Windows domain by
the responsible IT staff).  You can experiment a bit, by specifying the
username for NTLM authentication in &quot;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/fetchmail-users">user at domain</A>&quot; form, like:

poll imap02.ndc.nasa.gov proto imap
...user &quot;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/fetchmail-users">joe at AD</A>&quot; ...

on the assumption that the username is joe and the domain AD. The
corresponding syntax when mounting network drives/shares would be AD\joe
(but that would send the entire string as username).  There's probably
some organizational policy as to how the clients (possibly MS Outlook
2010) are supposed to access the Exchange servers.

If there are IT support pages inside NASA stating how to configure
&quot;other clients&quot; like Thunderbird, or smartphones, then these might be
useful, tool.

Chances are that asking NASA's IT helpdesk might provide insights what
to use, hint them to losses along the way of migration; chances are that
Kerberos support is in place (the Exchange server advertises it, and
Active Directory servers are usually Kerberos-enabled), so you would
need to know a few bits of the Kerberos configuration, and fetch a
ticket-granting ticket with &quot;kinit serversusername&quot; -- providing that
you used ./configure --with-gssapi ... when installing fetchmail and
have Kerberos installed on your computer running fetchmail.

I know that fetchmail's GSSAPI support is fine because I have used it
for a few years (albeit against Cyrus, not Exchange).

&gt;<i> Therefore, I'll continue to use &quot;auth password,&quot; now that I see that SSL hides
</I>&gt;<i> the password.
</I>
That's the easy way. :)
