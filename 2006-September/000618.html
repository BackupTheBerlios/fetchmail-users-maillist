Lots of things, not least being the authentication method used and the
configuration of dovecot.

I should point out that, given that your install of fetchmail works
against other remote servers the problem is almost certainly related
to the configuration of the dovecot server.

&gt;<i> of course, but the password should be the same, shouldn't it?
</I>
Yes, but my point is that dovecot does not necessarily accept the
authentication method that fetchmail is trying to use from a remote
host (or even a local one).

I would advise you do the following:

1) Increase the logging level on the dovecot server.  That will tell
you why the connection is failing.

2) Install fetchmail locally on the dovecot server.  Try doing a mail
check both against localhost and it's external IP.

3) Try any other remote client from the linux box.

At the very least you need to do (1).  Until you do that we don't know
why the dovecot server isn't accepting the connections.
