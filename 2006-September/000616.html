I have exactly zero experience of dovecot, so couldn't tell you.  Some
POP/IMAP servers however default to requiring SSL for unsecure auth
methods.

</I>
Well, one quick test would be to use any other IMAP/POP client (from
the home linux PC) against the remote server to confirm that the
username/password are correct.

(Note that using squirrelmail doesn't necessarily test the same
connection methods, squirrelmail may be configured to use the loopback
interface, which may have different, eg lower, security settings).
