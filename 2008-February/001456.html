Sorry, I shouldn't have posted those other messages. I get that ever so
often. Im logging in fine today.

No other client accesses my gmail and I only used the web interface
today to see if there were in fact NO emails to be had. That is why Im
stumped.

Apparently there is something wrong with my getting mail from google
because I now Im getting this message repeatedly:

Fetchmail could not get mail from <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/fetchmail-users">it at gmail-pop.l.google.com.</A>

The attempt to get authorization failed.
This probably means your password is invalid, but some servers have
other failure modes that fetchmail cannot distinguish from this
because they don't send useful error messages on login failure.

The fetchmail daemon will continue running and attempt to connect
at each cycle.  No future notifications will be sent until service
is restored.


I checked the password and there is no problem there. Googles end maybe?
Wade
