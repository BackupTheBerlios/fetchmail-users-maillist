<PRE>Greetings,

in an effort to get sufficient testing, I have released the next alpha
version of fetchmail 7.0.0.

This version ports the MAPI support from GSoC 2008 forward onto the
current branch and onto openchange 0.11, but is untested -- I have no
Exchange account and cannot test beyond &quot;it compiles, with massive
warnings&quot;.  Chances are it works on 32-bit versions of Ubuntu 11.04
(natty narwhal), but chances are MAPI support does not work at all.

I need help to bring this forward.

The alpha version isn't available through BerliOS, but only from
DOWNLOAD: &lt;<A HREF="http://home.pages.de/~mandree/fetchmail/">http://home.pages.de/~mandree/fetchmail/</A>&gt;

The corresponding git tag is SNAPSHOT_7-0-0-alpha2+MAPI, the branch is
&quot;master&quot;.

Please send feedback to <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/fetchmail-users">fetchmail-devel at lists.berlios.de.</A>

Happy fetches!
Matthias

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

fetchmail-7.0.0 (not yet released):

NOTE THIS IS AN ALPHA RELEASE THAT HAS NOT BEEN THOROUGHLY TESTED!

NOTE THAT THE MAPI FEATURE IS ENTIRELY UNTESTED AND UNSUPPORTED!

# MAJOR CHANGES
* The UIDL handler code is now much faster, especially noticable with lots of
  mail kept on a POP3 server. Where the 6.3.X code was of O(n^2) complexity,
  we're down to O(n log n).
  Contributed by Rainer Weikusat, MAD Partners Ltd./MSS GmbH.
* The POP3 code now always uses UIDL, except if &quot;fetchall&quot; is in effect.
  Fixes BerliOS Bug #16172. Fixes Debian Bug#345788.
* Fetchmail now enables SSL support by default. If this is undesired,
  ./configure --without-ssl should help.

# FEATURES ADDED
* Fetchmail can now retrieve credentials from PWMD. This needs to be enabled at
  compile-time and requires run-time configuration. See README.PWMD for details.
  Contributed by Ben Kibbey, author of libpwmd and pwmd.
* Fetchmail now supports a retrieve-error command line or rcfile option that
  takes exactly one argument, abort (default), continue or markseen.  This
  specifies the policy used by fetchmail to handle messages whose bodies
  fail to be retrieved due to server errors.  Both the continue and markseen
  options will skip the message with errors and allow the session to
  continue so that subsequent messages can be retrieved.  The markseen
  option will also mark the message with errors as seen.
  The default policy is to abort the session whenever a server error occurs.
  Contributed by Craig Brown.
* Fetchmailconf offers cram-md5 and apop authentication.
* EXPERIMENTAL/UNSUPPORTED:
  MAPI support through OpenChange. Yang-Yan Li, Google Summer of Code 2008.
  With fixes from Mojmir Svoboda.
  Ported to OpenChange 0.11 by Matthias Andree.
  May not work properly on 64-bit computers.
  Note the code requires further cleanups and fixes and has not yet been audited
  for security. Do not use as privileged user. Use at your own risk.
  If you're ready to take all these risks, ./configure --enable-MAPI is the key.

# REMOVED FEATURES
* IMAP2 protocol support was removed.
* POP2 protocol support was removed.
* RPOP (not actually a protocol, but a variant of POP3) was removed
* POP3: the uidl option has been removed. It is always on.
* POP3: LAST is no longer used. It was removed from POP3 in 1994, and it could
  cause mail loss when the connection was interrupted or if clients besides
  fetchmail polled the mailbox.
* Trio was removed, fetchmail expects reasonable stdio.h quality levels.
* Support for systems that do not conform to C89 and POSIX 2001 was removed,
  this means that BeOS, EMX, NeXTSTEP quirks are no longer worked around.
* The MX and host alias DNS lookups that fetchmail performs in multidrop mode
  have been removed. They were based on the mistaken assumption that the
  IMAP/POP3 server was also the MX server, which is rarely the case.  They have
  never supported IPv6 (including IPv6-mapped IPv4) either.
  Non-DNS based alias keywords such as &quot;aka&quot; remain.
* Kerberos IV support was removed.
* fetchmail no longer supports SSL v2, nor the corresponding SSL2 option to
  --sslproto. SSLv2 is insecure and had been deprecated 15 years ago. fetchmail
  will actively forbid SSLv2 negotiation by means of SSL_OP_NO_SSLv2.
  To fix Debian Bug#622054.
* A lot of outdated and/or unsafe-to-use material got dropped from contrib/.

# REGRESSION FIXES
* The mimedecode feature now properly detects multipart/mixed-type matches, so
  that quoted-printable-encoded multipart messages can get decoded.
  (Regression in 5.0.0 on 1999-03-27, as a side effect of a PGP-mimedecode fix
  attributed to Henrik Storner.)

# BUG FIXES
* The mimedecode feature failed to ship the last line of the body if it was
  encoded as quoted-printable and had a MIME soft line break in the very last
  line.  Reported by Lars Hecking in June 2011.
  Bug introduced on 1998-03-20 when the mimedecode support was added by ESR
  before release 4.4.1 through code contributed by Henrik Storner.
  Workaround for older releases: do not use mimedecode feature.
* Fetchmail now detects singly-quoted % expansions in the mda option and refuses
  to deliver for safety reasons. Fixes Debian Bug#347909.

# CHANGES
* A foreground fetchmail can now accept a few more options while another copy is
  running in the background.
* APOP is no longer a protocol, but an authentication method. In order to use
  it, use protocol POP3 auth APOP, or on the commandline, -p pop3 --auth apop.
  If no authentication method is specified, APOP is automatically tried if
  offered by the server before we resort to sending the password as clear text.
