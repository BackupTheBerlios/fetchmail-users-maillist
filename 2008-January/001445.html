<PRE>G'day there Matthias,

&gt;<i> you're right, and even claiming fetchmailconf were only kept at back
</I>&gt;<i> burner would be a major exaggeration... I know virtually nothing of Tk,
</I>&gt;<i> so if there are magic attributes to set, someone let me know or send a
</I>&gt;<i> patch to make Tk add scrollbars automatically.
</I>
	I was reminded off list that KDE (and possibly other wms) allows one to
use a combination key stroke &amp; mouse button that I now forget, that
allows movement of the window. In Gnome, I was unable to move the
fetchmailconf window any higher than the menu bar across the top of the
screen. KDE allowed me to move it off the screen in that direction and
gain access to the lower parts of the tkinter form so the problem was
solved. Not ideal, but it worked.

&gt;<i> I'd be happy to see someone else restructure the whole UI and rewrite
</I>&gt;<i> that utility in a much more ergonomic and self-explaning way with a
</I>&gt;<i> modern toolkit, be that Gtk+, Qt, wxWidgets or perhaps something else
</I>
	I'd be happy to have a go at it myself, except that the only coding
I've ever performed successfully has been 1 bash script and a few MS
Excel VB applications. I don't know anything about mail configuration or
any other languages. Hence there's little point me even making a token
effort.

&gt;<i> that is reasonably portable, and I don't mind if that then happens to be
</I>&gt;<i> C++, C# (if that person can help me getting C# autoconf/automake stuff
</I>&gt;<i> done and the possibility of excluding this from the build), Lua or Ruby
</I>&gt;<i> instead of Python.  Perl or shell might not be the best choice though.
</I>
	Sorry, as per above I can't help with any of that.

&gt;<i> If that doesn't happen before 6.4 enters release candidate status, I'll
</I>&gt;<i> probably drop fetchmailconf or toss it to contrib/ so as to mark it
</I>&gt;<i> unsupported.
</I>
	So be it. You've only got so much time to spare and obviously you have
other priorities.

&gt;<i> Sorry, but I'm already way behind with 6.3.9, so I took the decision of
</I>&gt;<i> letting fetchmailconf long a go.
</I>
	...are you trying to tell us that you have a life as well?!! &lt;g&gt;

&gt;<i> Volunteers to the rescue! (To coordinate efforts and avoid duplication
</I>&gt;<i> thereof, please use the fetchmail-devel mailing list. It's very low
</I>&gt;<i> traffic.)
</I>
	As much as I'd like to be there I don't have the skills.

&gt;<i> Thanks in advance and best regards
</I>
Take care. Thank you for your reply, and thank you for the work you've
already put into it.

See ya
