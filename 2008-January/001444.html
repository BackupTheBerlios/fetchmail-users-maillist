Hi Ken,

you're right, and even claiming fetchmailconf were only kept at back
burner would be a major exaggeration... I know virtually nothing of Tk,
so if there are magic attributes to set, someone let me know or send a
patch to make Tk add scrollbars automatically.

I'd be happy to see someone else restructure the whole UI and rewrite
that utility in a much more ergonomic and self-explaning way with a
modern toolkit, be that Gtk+, Qt, wxWidgets or perhaps something else
that is reasonably portable, and I don't mind if that then happens to be
C++, C# (if that person can help me getting C# autoconf/automake stuff
done and the possibility of excluding this from the build), Lua or Ruby
instead of Python.  Perl or shell might not be the best choice though.

If that doesn't happen before 6.4 enters release candidate status, I'll
probably drop fetchmailconf or toss it to contrib/ so as to mark it
unsupported.

Sorry, but I'm already way behind with 6.3.9, so I took the decision of
letting fetchmailconf long a go.

Volunteers to the rescue! (To coordinate efforts and avoid duplication
thereof, please use the fetchmail-devel mailing list. It's very low
traffic.)

Thanks in advance and best regards
