</I>
Well, you *can* call getaddrinfo() a second time before calling  
freeaddrinfo() first in Mac OS X without a crash or anything, and  
it's thread-safe since Mac OS X 10.2 (though not before). The only  
thing is that if you call it again with exactly the same query data  
and without calling freeaddrinfo() in between, it will report the  
data it cached from the last call. You might call this a bug, but  
Apple most probably will call it a feature ... Note that on Mac OS X,  
getaddrinfo() is nothing more than a wrapper around the system's so- 
called &quot;lookupd&quot; daemon, which handles all network addressing issues  
with code that's completely different from all other Unix  
implementations.

&gt;<i> However, you say that the problems happen after a certain...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> In my test case, getaddrinfo() may need up to 180s to time out.  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> However, I had set fetchmail's &quot;timeout&quot; parameter to only 60s. In  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> my  tests, during the time when the Internet connection was down,  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> at  least one &quot;timeout after 60 seconds waiting to connect to  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> server xy&quot;  did indeed appear in the log for each server.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ...amount of time.
</I>
If with &quot;amount of time&quot; you refer to the fact that the Internet must  
be down a certain amount of time for the issue to occur, this seems  
to be because the DNS data is cached for a certain amount of time,  
either by getaddrinfo() itself, or by Mac OS X's local caching BIND,  
or possibly by the caching name server of my router. Only when  
there's no cache anymore and getaddrinfo() (unsuccessfully) tries to  
retrieve that query data anew from the Internet, the timeout  
interruption will occur and prevent freeaddrinfo() from being called.

At least that's how I interpret all these error lines in my  
logfiles. ;-)

&gt;<i> Can you check with &quot;lsof&quot; or similar tools (that can list open  
</I>&gt;<i> files and sockets) how many files and sockets fetchmail holds open  
</I>&gt;<i> at the time when the problems start? It might be that the OS itself  
</I>&gt;<i> is leaking sockets here which might appear in fetchmail's address  
</I>&gt;<i> space.
</I>
I don't think there's a problem, but I will test it anyway and report  
as soon as I'll find time for another forced network outage.

&gt;&gt;<i> So I'm quite sure that's the bug: Care must be taken that  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> freeaddrinfo() is called even if SockOpen() is interrupted by a  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> timeout.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Certainly, and to avoid leaking memory on disconnected computers  
</I>&gt;<i> would be reason enough to justify such a fix.
</I>
Maybe it's a good idea to check for all occurrences of freeaddrinfo()  
whether they are certain to be performed whenever they should.  
Glimpsing at the code, e.g. in servport.c, line 65, the default  
switch condition is a goto jump that prevents freeaddrinfo() from  
being called, although it should be called (getaddrinfo() had  
returned 0/success before, so &quot;res&quot; had been allocated). It seems  
that calling freeaddrinfo() was not taken all too seriously  
throughout fetchmail.

&gt;&gt;<i> So you must either make ai0 a global variable (which won't work if  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> you plan to make fetchmail open more than one socket  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> simultaneously), or declare it in the calling code (driver.c or  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> whatever) and pass it to SockOpen.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;you'll have to&quot; or &quot;you may have to&quot; sounds more polite than &quot;you  
</I>&gt;<i> must&quot; (no offense taken, don't worry).
</I>
Well, the force of the laws of logic isn't polite ... ;-)  (This was  
not meant to be a social &quot;must&quot; but rather a logical one, as I indeed  
see no other programming techniques to deal with that issue.)

&gt;<i> Bugs related to signal handling (which is used for timeout  
</I>&gt;<i> handling) require extra care. I myself will have to review the code  
</I>&gt;<i> again before making changes in that area.
</I>&gt;<i> [...]
</I>&gt;<i> I don't think I'll be able to handle this before Saturday, perhaps  
</I>&gt;<i> Sunday; but providing patches for you to test should be feasible.
</I>
Well, that's more than OK with me! If you deal with bugs in  
connection with Mac OS X, what you are afraid of are months or years  
until a fix is applied - days are no problem at all.  :-)

&gt;<i> Note that I don't have MacOS X machines to test on either.
</I>
No problem, I can test this here.

&gt;<i> Thank you!
</I>
Well, thank you (in advance) for the fix!  :-)


             Bye
