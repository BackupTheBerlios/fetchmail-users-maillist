Something is missing here... Why do you need fetchmail to do this ?
Don't you have one account per user with one password for each user on
the linux server ? It seems to me that this part you have got running
faces the same problem you are asking a solution for ? Fetchmail must
download the mails from the user's mailbox and it must know about all
the user names and passwords... How did you got it running ?

BTW, here, a .forward file per user would be perfect and more reliable
than fetchmail... If your server is running usermin, the user can even
remove the redirection by himself when he starts fetching his mails on
the linux server.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> However the problem is that internal users will continue to send email

</I>&gt;<i> mailbox.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What I want to do is pull any mail which may arrive out of the exhange

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I was hoping either pop3 or imap would have an authentication type which

</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>
No. As far as I know, imap and pop3 provide access to one and only one
mailbox and more specifically to the mailbox that was named during the
authentication. In fact, you don't provide a user name with some rights
attached to it when you use pop3 or imap. You provide the name of a
mailbox. (Somebody fix this if I'm wrong !)

But that doesn't mean you have to create the dreaded list of
user/password now...

Can you tell exchange to redirect the mails of the users that already
moved to the linux server ? I'm thinking about an alias or something
like that to an internal server name such as <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/fetchmail-users">user at linux.yourdomain.com.</A>
That domain would be considered local by the linux server and the
exchange server would just have to know the route to that server.

Or could you divert the mails of those users to a single account on the
exchange server and fetch the mails from that account ?

Frederic
