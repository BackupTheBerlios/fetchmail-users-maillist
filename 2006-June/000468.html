Nothing wrong here.

&gt;<i> If with &quot;amount of time&quot; you refer to the fact that the Internet must

</I>&gt;<i> to be because the DNS data is cached for a certain amount of time,

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> At least that's how I interpret all these error lines in my  
</I>&gt;<i> logfiles. ;-)
</I>
Well, that's plausible, but I wonder if the resolver would finally
recover a long time after the network connection has been restored - and
perhaps if the negative TTL of cache entries can be configured.

But OTOH, if you say that proper freeaddrinfo() use avoids the problem,
then we don't need to think about this part, because I will add the
missed freeaddrinfo() calls.

&gt;<i> Maybe it's a good idea to check for all occurrences of freeaddrinfo()  
</I>&gt;<i> whether they are certain to be performed whenever they should.  
</I>&gt;<i> Glimpsing at the code, e.g. in servport.c, line 65, the default  
</I>&gt;<i> switch condition is a goto jump that prevents freeaddrinfo() from  
</I>&gt;<i> being called, although it should be called (getaddrinfo() had  
</I>&gt;<i> returned 0/success before, so &quot;res&quot; had been allocated). It seems  
</I>&gt;<i> that calling freeaddrinfo() was not taken all too seriously  
</I>&gt;<i> throughout fetchmail.
</I>
I'll defend myself by calling these plain bugs, rather than not taking
these calls &quot;not ... too seriously&quot;.

&gt;<i> Well, the force of the laws of logic isn't polite ... ;-)  (This was  
</I>&gt;<i> not meant to be a social &quot;must&quot; but rather a logical one, as I indeed  
</I>&gt;<i> see no other programming techniques to deal with that issue.)
</I>
Perhaps not in C. In the long run (fetchmail 7 or thereabouts), I might
switch to something more OOP-like so I can use objects that know how to
destruct themselves. (C++ is most likely from today's point of view.)

&gt;<i> Well, that's more than OK with me! If you deal with bugs in  
</I>&gt;<i> connection with Mac OS X, what you are afraid of are months or years  
</I>&gt;<i> until a fix is applied - days are no problem at all.  :-)
</I>
Alright. Below is a fix to the problem you reported for servport.c (it
was easy to fix), please try and let me know if MacOS X works with the
IPPROTO_TCP stuff.  The other getaddrinfo() calls require more attention
and I'll see to them later.
The &quot;NEWS&quot; hunk below will probably fail to apply, this is harmless.
