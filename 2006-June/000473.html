When I encountered this fetchmail bug for the first time in real  
life, fetchmail had stopped fetching mails for several *days*. So  
even if it recovered after a &quot;long time&quot;, this would be of no  
practical value at all.

&gt;<i> - and perhaps if the negative TTL of cache entries can be configured.
</I>
I know of no such configuration possibilities in my case, but anyway,  
since getaddrinfo() works as it should once freeaddrinfo() is  
properly called, I don't think this is a caching issue at all.

&gt;<i> But OTOH, if you say that proper freeaddrinfo() use avoids the  
</I>&gt;<i> problem, then we don't need to think about this part, because I  
</I>&gt;<i> will add the missed freeaddrinfo() calls.
</I>
Exactly.

&gt;<i> I'll defend myself by calling these plain bugs, rather than not  
</I>&gt;<i> taking these calls &quot;not ... too seriously&quot;.
</I>
Just having a cursory glance at the remaining code, there are at  
least two other occurrences of freeaddrinfo() calls that could be  
prevented by a timeout in do_session() in driver.c:

One is directly in driver.c, line 1043.

The other are actually 4 occurrences of freeaddrinfo() in  
checkalias.c that, via several function calls, end up being called in  
line 1430 in driver.c in the fetch_messages() call. Depending on the  
method you'll use, these could be tricky to handle, because as I said  
there are several function calls between the fetch_messages() call  
and these freeaddrinfo() calls.

&gt;<i> Alright. Below is a fix to the problem you reported for servport.c  
</I>&gt;<i> (it was easy to fix),
</I>
Indeed. :-)

&gt;<i> please try and let me know if MacOS X works with the IPPROTO_TCP  
</I>&gt;<i> stuff.
</I>
Yep, it compiles just fine. Apart from that, there's not much to  
test, yet. :-)

             Bye
                     Uli
