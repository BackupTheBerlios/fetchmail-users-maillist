However, you'd have to be subscribed to do that, and if somebody were
stupid enough to do it then the following *would* happen promptly:

a) They'd be reported to their ISP
b) Their address would be unsubscribed (and I'd keep a note of the
source IP to ban them in future)

Worth noting too that the situation reported doesn't seem to by
typical.  Certainly on the occasions I've hit similar problems with
malformed email rejected by my SMTP server fetchmail happily carries
on fetching the other mail.  This suggests that the problem is a local
config issue.  Sadly without the OP providing the (much requested)
output of &quot;fetchmail -v -v&quot; it's impossible to do anything but
speculate.
