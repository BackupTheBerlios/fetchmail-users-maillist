<PRE>-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

Greetings,

after a few not so easy fixes, I am providing a fetchmail snapshot,
dubbed fetchmail 6.3.5-beta1, for public preview.
Download location: &lt;<A HREF="http://mandree.home.pages.de/fetchmail/">http://mandree.home.pages.de/fetchmail/</A>&gt;

Changes in fetchmail 6.3.5-beta1 (since 6.3.4 release):

# NEW DEPRECATION WARNINGS:
* The &quot;envelope Received&quot; option may be removed from a future release, because
  the Received header was never meant to be machine-readable, the format varies
  widely, and various other differences in behavior make parsing Received an
  unreliable undertaking. The enveloper option as such will remain though, in
  order to support Delivered-To, X-Envelope-To, X-Original-To and similar.
  See also &lt;<A HREF="http://home.pages.de/~mandree/mail/multidrop">http://home.pages.de/~mandree/mail/multidrop</A>&gt;.
* Kerberos IV support may be removed from a future fetchmail release.
* SIGHUP wakeup may be removed from a future fetchmail release and cause it
  to terminate.
* Support for operating systems that are not sufficiently POSIX compliant may be
  removed or operation on such systems may be suboptimal for future releases.

# KNOWN BUGS AND LIMITATIONS:
+* fetchmail expects Received: headers in a particular format when parsing
+  envelopes.

# BUG FIXES:
* For protocols such as IMAP that are not delimited by &quot;.&quot; lines, truncate the
  input buffer when the message has been completely read, to avoid taking
  trailing garbage into the message if the terminal CRLF is missing. Fixes
  Debian Bug#312415. (Patch suggested by Mike Jones, Manchester Univ.).
* When using NTLM authentication, use regular IMAP response code handler after
  completing NTLM handshake, for robustness and consistency.
  (Taken from the NetBSD portable packages collection, patch-ac.)
* Support Kerberos installations where krb5.h and perhaps roken.h are in
  .../include/krb5.  Taken from NetBSD portable packages collection patch-ae.
* On NetBSD, link against -lroken -lcom_err if --with-kerberos is enabled.
* Drop #include &lt;com_err.h&gt; from Kerberos 5 header file, fixes compile error on
  SUSE Linux 10.0.
* Fix des_pcbc_encrypt compile warnings in kerberos.c line 246.
* If krb5-config provides gssapi library information, use that rather than
  guessing.
* Improve --with-gssapi auto detection for /usr-based GSSAPI installs.
* Fix --with-gssapi builds for NetBSD 3.0.
* Improve KAME/getnameinfo.c portability to Linux libc5 systems.
  Based on a patch by Dan Fandrich.
* Provide INET6 to KAME/getnameinfo.c (only useful on IPv6-enabled systems that
  lack getnameinfo, and there only visible in some Received: headers).
  Found by Dan Fandrich.
* POP3: some UID flags may not be set properly on UIDL lists. (Sunil Shetye)
* Make IMAP4 IDLE work on servers that do not update RECENT counts.
  Reported by Lars Tewes.
* IMAP4 patch by Sunil Shetye:
  - do not depend on server updating RECENT counts at all
  - also enter IDLE loop when messages are present on the server.
* Fix --flush description in the manual page, fetchmail does not mark messages
  seen unless it has successfully delivered them. Suggested by Frederic Marchal.
* Fetchmail no longer attempts to stat the &quot;-&quot; file in daemon mode -- this is a
  special name to read the RC file from stdin, and cannot always be re-read
  anyways. BerliOS bug #7858.
* When looking up ports for a service, the lookup succeeds and the returned
  address family isn't IPv4 or IPv6, properly free the allocated memory from the
  service lookup. Found by Uli Zappe.
* When looking up ports for a service, only look up TCP ports.
* Avoid compiling empty files, to avoid diagnostics from strict compilers.
* If the lockfile ends before the process ID, treat it as stale and unlink it.
  Reported by Justin Pryzby, Debian Bug #376603.
* SIGHUP wake-up behavior was broken since 5.9.13's Cygwin changes, in that for
  non-root users, SIGHUP would abort the first poll and subsequently interfere
  with new polls, and SIGHUP would be ignored for root users. SIGHUP now matches
  documented behavior. SIGUSR1 has always been a wakeup signal for both root
  (undocumented) and non-root users. See also the deprecation warning above.
* When a connection fails, log not only the IP address, but also host and
  service name and the port number. Log the latter when trying to connect in
  verbose mode, too.
* Keep syslog output at one line per message (this works if no errors occur).
* Track getaddrinfo() results to properly free them after timeouts,
  reported by Uli Zappe.  This MIGHT fix Debian Bug#294547 and Bug#377135.
* Fetchmail in verbose mode now logs if it opportunistically upgrades a POP3
  or IMAP connection to TLS security with STLS/STARTTLS.
* --logfile is now handled more carefully, errors opening the logfile are
  now reported to the TTY where fetchmail was started from.
* fetchmail now complains and aborts when it cannot properly daemonize itself.
* fetchmail now supports <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/fetchmail-users">foo at example.org</A>=bar user mappings for multidrop boxes.

# CHANGES:
* Rename all fetchmail-internal lock_* functions to fm_lock_*. Obsoletes
  NetBSD portable packages collection patch-ah, patch-ai and patch-aj.
* Configure prints a warning (but proceeds) if Kerberos IV support is enabled.
* In verbose mode, log every IP fetchmail tries to connect to, to avoid
  misleading the user. Suppress EAFNOSUPPORT errors from socket() call, too.
  Fixes Debian Bug #361825, reported by Daniel Baur.
* In idle mode, fetchmail complains about the fetchall option.

# CONTRIBUTED SCRIPTS:
* PopDel.py was revised by Joshua Crawford to display the From: address and
  list every email, even if it has no Subject: header; and not delete the wrong
  message in the presence of mail without Subject: headers.

Happy fetching,
Matthias Andree
