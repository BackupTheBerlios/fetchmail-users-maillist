Yes, there is.  It will however depend on the capabilities of your MTA,
and you may (depends on your MTA) need to install an MDA such as
maildrop (procmail is another option, but I'd like to discourage that -
it's got nasty intransparent fall-through-rules error &quot;handling&quot;, so go
for maildrop if you're into a new install).

The idea is to use for instance address extensions that you can use in
at least postfix, exim, sendmail, qmail.
For Postfix, see the recipient_delimiter documentation in local(8).
For Exim, check around the local_part_suffix* options in the
configuration and specification.
For sendmail and qmail, I forgot (and no longer care for) the
configuration details.  ISTR that sendmail's default configuration
enables address extensions with &quot;+&quot; and qmail the same with &quot;-&quot; as
delimiter.

Anyways, you should be able to arrange for a set of .forward+foo and
.forward+bar files that specify where you want mail to
&quot;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/fetchmail-users">rafa+foo at your.example.org</A>&quot; and &quot;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/fetchmail-users">rafa+bar at your.example.org</A>&quot; delivered.
(Assuming your login were &quot;rafa&quot;).
The fetchmail configuration would be quite similar to the one I
suggested, but you'd write &quot;... is rafa+foo here&quot; or &quot;...is rafa+bar
here&quot; as part of your configuration.


If and only if your MTA doesn't support address extensions AND you do
not want to switch MTA, consider installing an MDA (maildrop or
procmail, see above for comments) and use fetchmail's --mda option. I'd
say I clearly prefer the MTA approach as that would be valid
system-wide. Most MDAs support positional arguments on their command
line that will then be made available to the filter script in local
variables such as $1, $2, ..., so you can pass them in the &quot;mda&quot; option
for the account's user option.

Note that your mailer is broken, when quoting, it gets indentation
wrong and introduces additional line breaks. Please use a better mailer.
If you were using some online web form, please file a bug report with
the tech support and ask them to make sure that quoted material in
messages IS NOT REFLOWED OR REFORMATTED (i. e. NO ADDITIONAL LINE
BREAKS) except for the inserted &quot;&gt; &quot;.

&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; is &quot;/var/spool/mail/username&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; I would like to see the emails I receive from &quot;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/fetchmail-users">account1 at gmail.com</A>&quot; in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; file &quot;/var/spool/mail/account1&quot; for example,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; and emails from &quot;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/fetchmail-users">account2 at gmail.com</A>&quot; in the file
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;/var/spool/mail/account2&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; I don't want to have all emails mixed in the same file like it's
