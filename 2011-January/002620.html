<PRE>Dear Gerald Hopf,

&gt;<i> The man page says:
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Setting postmaster to the empty string causes such mail as
</I>&gt;<i> described above [this is referring to bouncemail] to be
</I>&gt;<i> discarded - this however is usually a bad idea&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> Not sure why this would be such a bad idea though, the
</I>&gt;<i> original mail isn't going to be deleted from the POP3 server
</I>&gt;<i> anyway if delivery fails :-)
</I>
Allowing the postmaster to be an empty string was introduced by me without any proper documentation. It was done more as a quick-fix measure to stop the downloading of imap body when the SMTP transaction fails at the MAIL FROM: or RCPT TO: level. fetchmail also communicates other messages (like repeated authorisation failures) via mails to the postmaster. So, it is a bad idea to set postmaster to an empty string because such important messages can get missed out.

&gt;<i> &gt; - There is no valid reason why fetchmail should use a
</I>&gt;<i> last-resort address. After all, if a bounce message has
</I>&gt;<i> already been sent and accepted, the right thing to do would
</I>&gt;<i> be to just drop the mail. Adding a default address means
</I>&gt;<i> that the postmaster would get flooded with all the 'User
</I>&gt;<i> unknown' messages. This design must have been to ensure that
</I>&gt;<i> local misconfiguration does not lead to permanent loss of
</I>&gt;<i> mail.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm getting the impression that I'm misusing fetchmail for
</I>&gt;<i> something it wasn't meant, and I would like to officially
</I>&gt;<i> apologize to everyone for that :-)
</I>
The failsafe design of fetchmail is basically meant to catch initial configuration errors. However, it does not make sense to keep on sending mails to postmaster forever.


Matthias, please check if these points should be implemented:

- Stop redirecting rejected mails (like 'User unknown') mails to postmaster as a last-resort address.

- If 'softbounce', do not send any bounce mail to the sender or to the postmaster. (as suggested by Martin)

- Undo documentation on setting postmaster to empty string. Ignore 'set postmaster &quot;&quot;' silently. Undo the damage I may have done. :-(

- Add a failsafe mode to fetchmail. It should be activated when the fetchmailrc is new (say, less than 1 week old). In failsafe mode, fetchmail will essentially activate softbounce. In daemon mode, after a week of running time, switch off the failsafe mode.
