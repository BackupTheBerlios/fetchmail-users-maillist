Yes, I saw this problem already with cygwin's 6.3.9. But 
fortunately we now have 6.3.19 in cygwin with support for soft 
bounces, so for me the use of postmaster delivery isn't necessary any 
more.

Because in this case I use cygwin and have no &quot;normal, unix-like&quot; 
local mail system, but only Exchange which required in default 
configuration esmtpuname/esmtppassword. I used as smtphost 
&quot;127.0.0.1&quot;, which works, but as you write for postmaster access the 
fixed server &quot;localhost&quot; is used, on Windows 2008R2 this gets resolved 
to ipv6 ::1 instead of 127.0.0.1, and Exchange has 2 distinct policies 
for ip4 and ip6. At least I now know that smtphost isn't always 
honored, and why mails to postmaster weren't delivered while other 
recipients worked ok.

When simply reading the man page entry for smtphost, I didn't thought 
automatically that far that (1) relaying of bounces might be a problem 
AND (2) that fetchmail already tries to workaround this by ignoring 
smtphost for bounces. So I would find it helpful to add these 2 
points to smtphost description. And also that esmtpname/esmtppassword 
are only applied to smtphost, and not the fixed &quot;localhost&quot; for 
bounces.

&gt;<i> Yes, fetchmail's bounce behaviour requires more work. However, that 
</I>&gt;<i> is not going to be trivial as any implicit assumptions are only 
</I>&gt;<i> going to muddle the issue further.
</I>
For my purposes, the soft bounces (i.e. letting the mail where it is 
when it can't be forwarded) are currently perfectly ok.
