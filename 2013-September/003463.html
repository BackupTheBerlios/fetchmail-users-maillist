Gene,

Well, there was strange behaviour you wanted to observe, and ask on the
Ubuntu list about support with building SSL-related stuff, or something.
Regarding exit codes, there is a convention for mailers and related
software that errors use system-specific error codes that are in
/usr/include/sysexits.h.  Fetchmail more or less adheres to that, most
importantly, exit code 0 means success, whatever EX_TEMPFAIL get
assigned (usually 75 on Linux) means temporary failure, and anything
else permanent failure.

&gt;<i> But after a decade of using fetchmail, I suppose its time for me to move on 
</I>&gt;<i> to something like getmail.  I have another drive all setup with 12.04.2 LTS 
</I>&gt;<i> on it, but that version of kmail is broken and Ingo K. et all are more 
</I>&gt;<i> concerned with adding yet more bells &amp; whistles without taking its memory 
</I>&gt;<i> usage and a gradually failing user interface to fix the bugs we report into 
</I>&gt;<i> consideration.
</I>
I've never enjoyed KDE4 for that matter.  However, I doubt the choice
mail fetching application will make much of a difference for what your
hints unveil about your intended uses; however, decent SSL support in
getmail is just emerging and to the best of my knowledge only available
for IMAP, so if you use it to fetch mail through the Internet, rather
than from your local machine, you may find that fetchmail can provide
more thorough SSL checking for the time being.

&gt;<i> Not your fault of course, I am just looking for a workable email solution I 
</I>&gt;<i> can use when I do make the change to running 12.04 full time.  KMail 
</I>&gt;<i> obvious isn't it so I'm looking at claws-mail, and trying to figure out how 
</I>&gt;<i> to integrate Dovecot into my local system so I can also handle email from 
</I>&gt;<i> my cnc lathes controller or my milling machines controller.  Or even from a 
</I>&gt;<i> laptop out in that same shop building.
</I>
Any mail corpus of nontrivial size will sooner or later cost some CPU
time, and possibly disk - most mailers will have to cache headers in RAM
as soon as you want some sort of sorting or threading, and anything that
involves sorting usually grows no faster than n*log(n), where n is the
number of messages to be sorted/displayed, and some systems even take
n*n.  The latter includes fetchmail if and only if POP3 and UIDL is used
while keeping thousands of messages on the server, and before the 7.X
alpha versions. The recent 7.0.0-alphas of fetchmail fix that speed
hogging and improve parsing the UIDL to n*log(n), and you can feel that
even if you have &quot;only&quot; 10,000 messages in the mailbox.

That imposes - more or less - a limit on how many messages are
reasonably held per mailbox. With some software, you will hit that
(unknown, and subject to your feeling of patience) limit sooner, with
other later.

mutt can be a hog at times, personally I am using Thunderbird although
that can also get long in the tooth when initially downloading mail.
Serving IMAP locally from Dovecot can help with speeding up clients if
their local data management is lacking, but their IMAP interface is decent.

HTH
Matthias
