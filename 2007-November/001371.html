Most probably you ought to check the Exim logfiles to see what happened
to those mails.

When you say you have got it working, do you mean that the first time it
ran, it didn't do something correctly?  Can you remember (or do you keep
logfiles of the fetchmail runs) whether fetchmail gave any error
messages?  If fetchmail didn't report any errors, this means that it
connected successfully to an SMTP server running on localhost (the
default delivery instructions), dutifully delivered all the fetched mail
to this SMTP server with 'RCPT TO lucy' (as instructed by your config),
and the SMTP server accepted all those messages for delivery.  If this
is the case, then it's up to Exim what it did with the messages that it
accepted from fetchmail.

On the other hand, if there were any problems in fetchmail's
communication with Exim, then fetchmail would not (and should not) have
&quot;flushed&quot; the incoming messages from the source - from where it fetched
them from - from the 'mail.server.com' POP3 server.  In that case, the
messages should be there, waiting for you to fetch them again - but
since you're asking, I assume that is not the case :/

Well, if the messages are not at the POP3 server, then fetchmail must
have flushed them, hence it must have thought it had passed them on
successfully, hence it must have delivered them to an SMTP server or
something - hence you should check the Exim logfiles for any messages
passing through it at that time.

G'luck,
Peter

I've heard that this sentence is a rumor.
