</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Hello,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I realize that you hate multidrop, and generally disparage and deprecate
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That would be &quot;procmail&quot;, and that antipathy is based on technical reasons.
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>No, I was talking fetchmail's &quot;multidrop&quot;, not maildrop or procmail. As 
a matter of fact, I AM using procmail, but that's more of an historical 
accident than preference. When I moved my email over to my new 
infrastructure, (new server, Postfix instead of Exim, Dovecot instead of 
UWash IMAP, etc.) I considered replacing procmail with maildrop. I got 
the definite impression that maildrop is the better tool, but by this 
time my procmail rules are all working, and I didn't feel like fussing 
with it. Maybe some time, when I have time, I'll reexamine this issue.

One other reason, now obsolete... For a while I was running procmail 
under xinetd as an lmtp server. The basic idea was to completely chroot 
postfix, instead of having to leave the local delivery part un-chrooted. 
I eventually decided I'd rather have postfix local delivery un-chrooted 
and running with elevated authority than procmail, even though both try 
to drop privileges when possible. Now if maildrop had an lmtp mode...
&gt;<i>   
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the heck out of it, but for some of us, it's about the only way to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> make our email come out halfway decent.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Certainly not. Maildrop is, in many cases, a better alternative to
</I>&gt;<i> procmail and more than just a surrogate, and I have yet to see a
</I>&gt;<i> reasonable procmail construct that you can't write in maildrop or that
</I>&gt;<i> would look uglier.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'll concede I'm biased WRT maildrop's syntax which borrows a bit from
</I>&gt;<i> C/C++/Java, but the other reasons like error handling are so much better
</I>&gt;<i> in maildrop it's worth a look. Even if your .procmailrc has two dozen
</I>&gt;<i> rules, it's worth the switch.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Given the text of this announcement, I need to ask some questions, and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> also see if I'm going to have to squirrel away a &quot;last usable&quot; copy of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> fetchmail source at some point.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It's not that fetchmail would stop working with procmail, or something
</I>&gt;<i> else, but rather that I'm not going to help you with getting procmail to
</I>&gt;<i> work with fetchmail and vice versa. I don't intend to waste my time
</I>&gt;<i> helping people to shoot themselves in their feet.
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>As I said, the whole issue is fetchmail's multidrop mode. The rest of 
your letter has satisfied my concerns quite nicely. It looks like that 
work I did after the 6.3.2 upgrade was well worth it, and the right 
thing to do. I'm guessing that when 6.3.4 makes it to Gentoo x86 I'll 
have no problems with the upgrade.
&gt;<i>   
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> # DEPRECATED FEATURES AND MAJOR INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE ADVANCE WARNINGS
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> * The MX and host alias DNS lookups that fetchmail performs in multidrop mode
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>   are obsolete, deprecated and may be removed from a future fetchmail version.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>   They have never supported IPv6 (including IPv6-mapped IPv4) anyhow.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>       
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Is this the 'aka' being deprecated, or is it some implicit lookup that I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> won't have to worry about, as long as I have 'aka' properly set up?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The implicit automatic DNS lookups. &quot;aka&quot; will continue to work. The
</I>&gt;<i> implicit lookups assume the POP3 or IMAP server were the same as the
</I>&gt;<i> SMTP server of the ISP, which is often untrue nowadays.
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>Interestingly enough, since I own a domain and have an email forwarding 
service for all mail to that domain to be sent to my pop box at my ISP, 
I find that I needed to add 'aka' statements for the domain-host's 
forwarding machines. That made everything work *perfectly*, which it 
never had before. I suspect you also changed the &quot;-v -v&quot; debugging 
information some, because this time it was absolutely clear what I 
needed to do with 'aka' statements to make things work. I don't remember 
the debugging information being that useful, before.

Thanks,
Dale Pontius
&gt;<i>   
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Related to the 'aka' question, I noticed that when I upgraded to 6.3.2,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> multidrop pretty much fell apart for me, delivering all mail to the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> default id. I went back and RTFM, ran fetchmail with extra '-v's, added
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> some extra 'aka's, and actually got it running better than ever.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Well, that is, in fact, the reason why the automatisms will go and users
</I>&gt;<i> will have to use &quot;aka&quot; and thereabouts after 6.4.0.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It's not like a hundred of aliased domains were changing every day, so
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;aka&quot; will work well enough for most.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Most notably, we'd always lived with some duplicates that were now
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> resolved and eliminated. Given that I've already spent the effort to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> adapt to the jump from 6.2.x to 6.3.2, am I set for the foreseeable
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> future, or do these notes presage major pain to come?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The exact effect will, of course, depend on configuration. Assuming the
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;aka&quot; configuration covers all the destination addresses, that part
</I>&gt;<i> would very likely be set.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The announcements are mainly there so people who intend to upgrade from
</I>&gt;<i> 6.3.X to a newer 6.4, 6.Y, 7.0, ... release know where to look before
</I>&gt;<i> actually installing the newer version. My idea is letting users make an
</I>&gt;<i> /informed/ decision. No more luring people into &quot;gold&quot; versions with
</I>&gt;<i> radical changes.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I will keep an eye on compatibility in configuration where that is
</I>&gt;<i> feasible and sensible. But do you know anyone who's using POP2 to fetch
</I>&gt;<i> mail? I don't. Do you know any ISP where the MX is the POP3 server so
</I>&gt;<i> that implicit DNS lookups to detect domain aliases actually work? None
</I>&gt;<i> of mine does.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I only WISH my ISP would support ssl/tls, or etrn, or odmr. I'm STUCK
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> with multidrop, unless I spring for more $$$ to use a different provider
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> for my email. I'm already paying $$$$ for a cable ISP and $$ for my
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> domain and forwarding, not to mention $$.$e$$ for kids' education, so
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> $$$ just to avoid multidrop just isn't in the cards, for now. (My ISP
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> has multiple POP boxes, but my domain forwarding doesn't have enough
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> capability, so I use multidrop.)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Well, multidrop can work if done right. See
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;<A HREF="http://home.pages.de/~mandree/mail/multidrop">http://home.pages.de/~mandree/mail/multidrop</A>&gt; - if the requirements
</I>&gt;<i> listed there are met, multidrop will work reliably, without any
</I>&gt;<i> duplicate/undeliverable messages (except those with mistyped or guessed
</I>&gt;<i> addresses, think spammers trying a dictionary of local addresses on your
</I>&gt;<i> *@your.example.org catchall multidrop).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As long as hashed authentication schemes such as CRAM-MD5 or APOP are
</I>&gt;<i> supported by your ISP, SSL/TLS is not actually needed, because the mail
</I>&gt;<i> has arrived at your provider's site unencrypted anyways and
</I>&gt;<i> APOP/CRAM-MD5 still protect your password from eavesdropping, and for
</I>&gt;<i> encrypted mail, there are GnuPG and S/MIME which don't require ISP
</I>&gt;<i> support, consent or something like that. And with Thunderbird with the
</I>&gt;<i> Enigmail extension, GnuPG is simple enough to use, too -- IMO.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> All in all, there will not be much to worry about that would make
</I>&gt;<i> fetchmail unusable.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
