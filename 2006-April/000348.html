&gt;<i> Hello,
</I>&gt;<i> I realize that you hate multidrop, and generally disparage and deprecate
</I>
That would be &quot;procmail&quot;, and that antipathy is based on technical reasons.

&gt;<i> the heck out of it, but for some of us, it's about the only way to
</I>&gt;<i> make our email come out halfway decent.
</I>
Certainly not. Maildrop is, in many cases, a better alternative to
procmail and more than just a surrogate, and I have yet to see a
reasonable procmail construct that you can't write in maildrop or that
would look uglier.

I'll concede I'm biased WRT maildrop's syntax which borrows a bit from
C/C++/Java, but the other reasons like error handling are so much better
in maildrop it's worth a look. Even if your .procmailrc has two dozen
rules, it's worth the switch.

&gt;<i> Given the text of this announcement, I need to ask some questions, and
</I>&gt;<i> also see if I'm going to have to squirrel away a &quot;last usable&quot; copy of
</I>&gt;<i> fetchmail source at some point.
</I>
It's not that fetchmail would stop working with procmail, or something
else, but rather that I'm not going to help you with getting procmail to
work with fetchmail and vice versa. I don't intend to waste my time
helping people to shoot themselves in their feet.

&gt;&gt;<i> # DEPRECATED FEATURES AND MAJOR INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE ADVANCE WARNINGS
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> * The MX and host alias DNS lookups that fetchmail performs in multidrop mode
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   are obsolete, deprecated and may be removed from a future fetchmail version.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   They have never supported IPv6 (including IPv6-mapped IPv4) anyhow.
</I>
&gt;<i> Is this the 'aka' being deprecated, or is it some implicit lookup that I
</I>&gt;<i> won't have to worry about, as long as I have 'aka' properly set up?
</I>
The implicit automatic DNS lookups. &quot;aka&quot; will continue to work. The
implicit lookups assume the POP3 or IMAP server were the same as the
SMTP server of the ISP, which is often untrue nowadays.

&gt;<i> Related to the 'aka' question, I noticed that when I upgraded to 6.3.2,
</I>&gt;<i> multidrop pretty much fell apart for me, delivering all mail to the
</I>&gt;<i> default id. I went back and RTFM, ran fetchmail with extra '-v's, added
</I>&gt;<i> some extra 'aka's, and actually got it running better than ever.
</I>
Well, that is, in fact, the reason why the automatisms will go and users
will have to use &quot;aka&quot; and thereabouts after 6.4.0.

It's not like a hundred of aliased domains were changing every day, so
&quot;aka&quot; will work well enough for most.

&gt;<i> Most notably, we'd always lived with some duplicates that were now
</I>&gt;<i> resolved and eliminated. Given that I've already spent the effort to
</I>&gt;<i> adapt to the jump from 6.2.x to 6.3.2, am I set for the foreseeable
</I>&gt;<i> future, or do these notes presage major pain to come?
</I>
The exact effect will, of course, depend on configuration. Assuming the
&quot;aka&quot; configuration covers all the destination addresses, that part
would very likely be set.

The announcements are mainly there so people who intend to upgrade from
6.3.X to a newer 6.4, 6.Y, 7.0, ... release know where to look before
actually installing the newer version. My idea is letting users make an
/informed/ decision. No more luring people into &quot;gold&quot; versions with
radical changes.

I will keep an eye on compatibility in configuration where that is
feasible and sensible. But do you know anyone who's using POP2 to fetch
mail? I don't. Do you know any ISP where the MX is the POP3 server so
that implicit DNS lookups to detect domain aliases actually work? None
of mine does.

&gt;<i> I only WISH my ISP would support ssl/tls, or etrn, or odmr. I'm STUCK
</I>&gt;<i> with multidrop, unless I spring for more $$$ to use a different provider
</I>&gt;<i> for my email. I'm already paying $$$$ for a cable ISP and $$ for my
</I>&gt;<i> domain and forwarding, not to mention $$.$e$$ for kids' education, so
</I>&gt;<i> $$$ just to avoid multidrop just isn't in the cards, for now. (My ISP
</I>&gt;<i> has multiple POP boxes, but my domain forwarding doesn't have enough
</I>&gt;<i> capability, so I use multidrop.)
</I>
Well, multidrop can work if done right. See
&lt;<A HREF="http://home.pages.de/~mandree/mail/multidrop">http://home.pages.de/~mandree/mail/multidrop</A>&gt; - if the requirements
listed there are met, multidrop will work reliably, without any
duplicate/undeliverable messages (except those with mistyped or guessed
addresses, think spammers trying a dictionary of local addresses on your
*@your.example.org catchall multidrop).

As long as hashed authentication schemes such as CRAM-MD5 or APOP are
supported by your ISP, SSL/TLS is not actually needed, because the mail
has arrived at your provider's site unencrypted anyways and
APOP/CRAM-MD5 still protect your password from eavesdropping, and for
encrypted mail, there are GnuPG and S/MIME which don't require ISP
support, consent or something like that. And with Thunderbird with the
Enigmail extension, GnuPG is simple enough to use, too -- IMO.

All in all, there will not be much to worry about that would make
fetchmail unusable.
