It's also pretty much my only option (and if I switch hosts as I plan,
it will be my only option), so I'm in favour of a solid multidrop. 
The problem has, IMO, been that historically much of the multidrop
stuff has been based around guesswork and has often given different
results from what was intended or expected.

Just take a look through the archive of the old list and you'll see :-)

</I>
Actually, I'm looking at switching from a provider that, in theory,
allows me to avoid the use of multidrop to one that would force this. 
I'm planning this because my current provider is, well, less than
brilliant :)  I've got a vested interest in multidrop staying.

However, I don't believe that there is any intention of removing
multidrop.  From my understanding the intention is to fix the parts
that are broken (or remove the parts that should never have been
there).

Of course, Matthias may come along and say I'm wrong, but I'm hoping not :-)
