<PRE>Hi Rob.

</I>You're right... I haven't seen that.

Actually I didn't even look, cause I thought our local institute's MTAs
were all configured to not accept mail with local addresses not being
sent from themselves, in which case my testmails would have bounced
back, when the local MTA would have seen them.
But there was an exception that allows local injection as fetchmail does
it.

So I thought fetchmail would work as e.g. getmail and store the mbox
iself.

Sorry for making useless noise. Well perhaps not totally useless, better
making noise and being sorry, than not finding issues.


The actual bad guy producing corrupted mboxo format here seems to be
postfix (by it's local deliver agent).


&gt;<i> It doesn't store any files at all, it doesn't have that
</I>&gt;<i> capability.
</I>Ok... is that sure? So no mode where it creates mbox by itself?
Otherwise one could check that, whether it uses mboxo or not.


&gt;<i> Right, so it is being handled over to your local SMTP server
</I>Yep.. shaming myself ;-) ... but as a little excuse for myself, I'm not
a fetchmail user, and didn't dig too deep into it's working O:-)


I guess answering Gene's mail is obsolete now.



Cheers,
Chris. :)
