</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; so I'm guessing your problem relates to the MTA or MDA
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; you've configured Fetchmail to use.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Well...
</I>&gt;<i> a) fetchmail doesn't contact a MTA or MDA, I use it with pop3 or
</I>&gt;<i> IMAP,... and that's the mail server's business, not the MTA's or MDA's.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>I don't recall when I ever ran fetchmail without a defined MTA, in this 
case procmail.  I didn't know it was usable by itself.  And this is since 
the late 90's!  '98 IIRC.  fetchmail also runs mailfilter, which can kill 
spam right on the server, but needs wrappers to absorb its return status 
for best fetchmail results.

I use procmail as the MTA, which in turn filters the mail through both 
spamassassin AND clamd.  That which survives that gauntlet is appended to 
the usually empty /var/spool/mail/gene in mailfile format by procmail.

That file being closed caused inotifywait to exit with the filename closed 
as a return value, which in turn triggers a script that sends kmail a &quot;get 
local mail' command over kmails dbus interface, which empties that file a 
millisecond later and the script starts a new session of inotifywait to 
watch for more incoming mail.  And I see it in kmail 2 or 3 seconds after 
fetchmail pulled it, and with only 1% of the lags kmail would have if it 
did its own mail suckage from the net.  And far better filtering.

There have been no formatting problems that kmail showed me in over a 
decade.

&gt;<i> b) It cannot be either of those, because when using other clients (e.g.
</I>&gt;<i> KMail, mutt) or when speaking plain pop3 via telnet the mail comes as it
</I>&gt;<i> should. And it's not the business of a mailserver to do any
</I>&gt;<i> quoting/formatting for the format that is used to store mails on the
</I>&gt;<i> client side.
</I>
My guess is that you may have something funkity in your postfix, qmail, 
maildrop or sieve configuration.  And why are you running qmail, its a 
server, not a client.

I deal with a qmail server at one of my accounts, and it very occasionally 
will give mailfilter a funkity timestamp that chokes mailfilter, so those 
usually spammish msgs I go ahead and let fetchmail fetch just to unclog the 
server.  That's why the wrapper that returns 0 to fetchmail regardless of 
how much of an upset tummy mailfilter claims to have.
 
&gt;<i> &gt; As however you've not provided any
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; details on your configuration that's about all I can guess - section
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; G3 of the FAQ details the information we need to help you.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I saw that but haven't though it would be necessary, as the issue seems
</I>&gt;<i> simply to be that fetchmail uses the broken mboxo format, nevertheless:
</I>&gt;<i> 1) Debian sid
</I>&gt;<i> 2) fetchmail package from Debian sid
</I>&gt;<i> 3) postifx, qmail  ... maildrop, sieve
</I>&gt;<i> 4) fetchmail with the fecthmailrc:
</I>&gt;<i> poll pop3.example.org with proto POP3
</I>&gt;<i> user <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/fetchmail-users">foo at example.org</A> there with password &quot;bar&quot; is &quot;foo&quot; here
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Cheers,
</I>&gt;<i> Chris.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;Please keep list traffic on the list.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Well the thing is... I don't use fetchmail myself, but reported this
</I>&gt;<i> issue just out of courtesy.... and I'm already subscribed to far too
</I>&gt;<i> many mailing lists.
</I>
So am I. :)

&gt;<i> Unfortunately one can only post as subscriber.
</I>&gt;<i> I thought my initial post would already explain everything in detail and
</I>&gt;<i> how to reproduce and solve it.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> But apart from that, I didn't remove any traffic from the list, did I?
</I>
You've added traffic to the fetchmail list that probably belongs on another 
list.  Shrug.

Cheers, Gene
