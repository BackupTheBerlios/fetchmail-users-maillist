&gt;<i> Fetchmail doesn't use any format
</I>Well it must... the mailserver gives you a mail with header and body via
pop3 or imap ... and &quot;you&quot; store it then either as mbox, maildir etc.
And it's not the mail server that tells you how the From_ lines look (in
case of mbox) or how to name the single maildir files.


&gt;<i> my emails are
</I>&gt;<i> unmodified
</I>Have you tried it with the transcript I've attached? And are you using
mbox?


&gt;<i> so I'm guessing your problem relates to the MTA or MDA
</I>&gt;<i> you've configured Fetchmail to use.
</I>Well...
a) fetchmail doesn't contact a MTA or MDA, I use it with pop3 or
IMAP,... and that's the mail server's business, not the MTA's or MDA's.

b) It cannot be either of those, because when using other clients (e.g.
KMail, mutt) or when speaking plain pop3 via telnet the mail comes as it
should. And it's not the business of a mailserver to do any
quoting/formatting for the format that is used to store mails on the
client side.


&gt;<i> As however you've not provided any
</I>&gt;<i> details on your configuration that's about all I can guess - section
</I>&gt;<i> G3 of the FAQ details the information we need to help you.
</I>I saw that but haven't though it would be necessary, as the issue seems
simply to be that fetchmail uses the broken mboxo format, nevertheless:
1) Debian sid
2) fetchmail package from Debian sid
3) postifx, qmail  ... maildrop, sieve
4) fetchmail with the fecthmailrc:
poll pop3.example.org with proto POP3
user <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/fetchmail-users">foo at example.org</A> there with password &quot;bar&quot; is &quot;foo&quot; here


Cheers,
Chris.

&gt;<i>Please keep list traffic on the list.
</I>Well the thing is... I don't use fetchmail myself, but reported this
issue just out of courtesy.... and I'm already subscribed to far too
many mailing lists. Unfortunately one can only post as subscriber.
I thought my initial post would already explain everything in detail and
how to reproduce and solve it.

But apart from that, I didn't remove any traffic from the list, did I?
