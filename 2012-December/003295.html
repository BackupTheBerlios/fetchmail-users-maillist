<PRE>The 6.3.24 release of fetchmail is now available at the usual locations,
including &lt;<A HREF="http://developer.berlios.de/projects/fetchmail">http://developer.berlios.de/projects/fetchmail</A>&gt; and

The source archive is available at - in XZ format:
&lt;<A HREF="http://prdownload.berlios.de/fetchmail/fetchmail-6.3.24.tar.xz">http://prdownload.berlios.de/fetchmail/fetchmail-6.3.24.tar.xz</A>&gt;
&lt;<A HREF="https://sourceforge.net/projects/fetchmail/files/branch_6.3/">https://sourceforge.net/projects/fetchmail/files/branch_6.3/</A>&gt;
(The sourceforge.net link may take a while before the files become
downloadable.)

Or, if you prefer the previous BZip 2 format:
&lt;<A HREF="http://prdownload.berlios.de/fetchmail/fetchmail-6.3.24.tar.bz2">http://prdownload.berlios.de/fetchmail/fetchmail-6.3.24.tar.bz2</A>&gt;

Here are the release notes:

fetchmail-6.3.24 (released 2012-12-23, 26108 LoC):

# NOTE THAT THE RELEASE OF FUTURE FETCHMAIL 6.3.X VERSIONS IS UNCLEAR.
Should a 7.0 release be made earlier, chances are that the 6.3.X branch
is abandoned and its changes be folded into the 7.0 release, with changes
after 6.3.24 not available on their own in a newer 6.3.X release.

# NOTE THAT FETCHMAIL IS NO LONGER PUBLISHED THROUGH IBIBLIO.
  They have stopped accepting submissions and consider themselves an archive.

# CRITICAL AND REGRESSION FIXES
* Plug a memory leak in OpenSSL's certificate verification callback.
  This would affect fetchmail configurations running with SSL in daemon mode
  more than one-shot runs.
  Reported by Erik Thiele, and pinned by Dominik Heeg,
  fixes Debian Bug #688015.
  This bug was introduced into fetchmail 6.3.0 (committed 2005-10-29)
  when support for subjectAltName was added through a patch by Roland
  Stigge, submitted as Debian Bug#201113.

* The --logfile option now works again outside daemon mode, reported by Heinz
  Diehl. The documentation that I had been reading was inconsistent with the
  code, and only parts of the manual page claimed that --logfile was only
  effective in daemon mode.

# KNOWN BUGS AND WORKAROUNDS
  (This section floats upwards through the NEWS file so it stays with the
  current release information)
* Fetchmail does not handle messages without Message-ID header well
  (See sourceforge.net bug #780933)
* BSMTP is mostly untested and errors can cause corrupt output.
* Sun Workshop 6 (SPARC) is known to miscompile the configuration file lexer in
  64-bit mode.  Either compile 32-bit code or use GCC to compile 64-bit
  fetchmail.  Note that fetchmail doesn't take advantage of 64-bit code,
  so compiling 32-bit SPARC code should not cause any difficulties.
* Fetchmail does not track pending deletes across crashes.
* The command line interface is sometimes a bit stubborn, for instance,
  fetchmail -s doesn't work with a daemon running.
* Linux systems may return duplicates of an IP address in some circumstances if
  no or no global IPv6 addresses are configured.
  (No workaround. Ubuntu Bug#582585, Novell Bug#606980.)
* Kerberos 5 may be broken, particularly on Heimdal, and provide bogus error
  messages. This will not be fixed, because the maintainer has no Kerberos 5
  server to test against. Use GSSAPI.
