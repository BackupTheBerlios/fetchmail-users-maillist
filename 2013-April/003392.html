Up front, thanks a bunch for the feedback.  We should move to
fetchmail-devel though...

I am wondering - especially about switching SSL library, too, because
OpenSSL requires you to jump quite through a few hoops for even standard
stuff, like CRLs and OCSP.

This line is to be dropped from TODO.txt -- I've seen too many
certification &quot;authorities&quot; that did not deserve this name, and I seem
to have someone willing to tell users in the fetchmail lobby how to make
_good_ use of this feature.

The missing link is that you hardly ever get the certificate
fingerprints on the &quot;how to configure Outlook, blahmail, whatever for
fetching mail from us&quot; on the ISP help pages, or even better, by snail
mail when they send you account data.

&gt;<i> #### config flexibility
</I>&gt;<i> Consider making 'poll [thing]'s thing just a label string. And
</I>&gt;<i> breaking apart the config into types:  'polls' with 'poll [label]',
</I>&gt;<i> 'hosts' with 'host [label]', and 'accounts' with 'account [label]'.
</I>&gt;<i> Put whatever you want in a label ... 'blah' '<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/fetchmail-users">joe at schmoe.com</A>',
</I>&gt;<i> 'foo.com', '1.2.3.4' ... but treat it as a label. 
</I>
Basically we're already quite close, we'd only have to make sure that
adding a poll argument on the command line permits specifying an
account. See &lt;<A HREF="http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=705291">http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=705291</A>&gt;,
for instance.

Your notion of

poll thing   host foo.example.org   account blah

is spelt

poll thing   via foo.example.org    user blah

today :-)

We lack group selection capability, though, as detailed in the Debian
BTS report linked above.

&gt;<i> Collect all poll types
</I>&gt;<i> into a set for daemon or oneshot runs. Account types are
</I>&gt;<i> always singly available for commandline oneshot's. 'netaddr'
</I>&gt;<i> may be fqdn, or ip (dns down/insecure scenario). Error out
</I>&gt;<i> if a label dependency does not exist. Order of types in file
</I>&gt;<i> does not matter, indented bits are type content. Includes
</I>&gt;<i> work.
</I>
That would be missing.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> ./fetch -p  # polls
</I>&gt;<i> ./fetch -a play2
</I>&gt;<i> ./fetch -a mywork -h work1_pop  # temporary swap :)
</I>&gt;<i> ./fetch -a play1  # bombs on foo1
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It's really really hard to get fetchmail to do anything like this
</I>&gt;<i> today. Unless you forget it and frontend it with your own config
</I>&gt;<i> and call engine. These sort of configs are powerful.
</I>
And require particular attention in tracing output (and possibly imply
&quot;verbose&quot; mode) so that we can give users a hint what they are doing and
what fetchmail is making of it, so that we can later properly dissect
bug reports.

Well, the other frequently asked feature is &quot;poll multiple hosts at the
same time&quot; (especially on high-speed-but-high-latency-links, such as
DSL, satellite), which needs to go hand in hand here.

The actual multithreading-the-input is not too hard to come by, the
question is how to limit the output side, and to assess if that is
necessary.

If you think ISP-grade &quot;POP collector option&quot; (disregarding it violates
most site's security policy to share credentials with another entity),
you may want to configure &quot;poll 50 accounts at the same time but only
use 20 outbound SMTP threads&quot;.  This requires caching mail, either in
RAM, or on disk.

I have updated the master's TODO.txt a tiny bit (near the end).
