<PRE>I was pleased to see on LWN that you guys are working on fetchmail,
I had no idea it had active maintainers.

Due to the advent of spamassassin, I am no longer able to accept lots
of messages at once via fetchmail -- it causes my laptop to thrash.  I
use sendmail -&gt; procmail -&gt; spamassassin, so using sendmail's load
average limit didn't really help the situation, since sendmail has no
idea it's kicked off a bunch of spamassassin processes that in a few
seconds will drive the load way up. (In this analysis I'm assuming that
it's only cpu time and not disk I/O which is causing the problem.)

I worked around this by adding expunge 1 (which since I'm using POP3
is similar to using a fetchlimit), which slows things down enough by
re-logging in repeatedly (wastefully) to avoid the problem. But this
doesn't work well when I'm on the road and have a bad network
connection; it slows things down quite a lot, especially when I have a
big inbox. (I see that I'm not using the new fetchsizelimit and
fastuidl options. But, there are more issues:) Also a large expunge
limit is simply a bad idea for slow connections if there are large
messages; the odds of something going wrong is drastically
increased. And if I move my laptop from the office to a hotel I
currently would have to change the expunge/fetchlimit value by hand.

I think what we really want is something which decides when to expunge
or limit based on the *size* of the messages downloaded. This would
address the current issue that we don't expunge very intelligently;
the point is that you don't want hugely long downloads which might be
interrupted and lose some state, so it makes sense to expunge more
frequently when large messages are being downloaded. One size doesn't
fit all.

 --fetchlimitsize n (kilobytes, default to 100 kilobytes? 1 meg?)
 --expungesize n (kilobytes, same default as fetchlimitsize)

In addition, we could use a rate limiter sending messages to sendmail
to dodge the spamassassin problem. My laptop takes 2 cpu seconds to
spamassassin a small email message (20 seconds elapsed) and so perhaps
a time-based measure with an optional addition for the message size
would do it. If you wanted to be clever you could compute this
dynamically by watching what happens when you throw a bunch of email
messages at sendmail, but to start:

 --mtacpu n (seconds, default to 0)
 --mtacpupermeg n (seconds per megabyte, default to 0)

so fetchmail would wait &quot;mtacpu + size / 1meg * mtacpupermeg&quot; seconds
before sending another message to the MTA. I'd set this to 2. Hm,
given that this value is small a floating-point value would be a
good idea instead of an integer.

Just another fetchmail user,

-- greg
