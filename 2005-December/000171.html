<PRE>hello all,
fetchmail has been awesome and worked flawlessly for years for me, thats
why this is so odd.  my system is redhat fedora core 3ish (i upgrade
packages as I need to) anyway I had an rpm of fetchmail 5.9.12 installed
which was working fine.  I did something dumb with postfix and stopped
receiving mail, while troubleshooting it I upgraded fetchmail to 
fetchmail-6.2.5-7.fc4.1.i386.rpm.  Once I found my problem with postfix
I verified that fetchmail could connect to my univeristy IMAP account
and it started downloading my mail.  Great.  Several days later I
realized I was no longer receiving mail from my comcast.new pop3 acocunt
which is AFTER my IMAP account in my fetchmailrc file.

After trying a number of different RPMs I grabbed my old working
fetchmail binary from a backup and low and behold everything was fine
again.  As you can see from the enclosed files there is not much of an
error.  More like a lack of anything.  I tried to capture the pop3
packets with ethereal and never saw anything after the host lookup.

So anyway I was curious if anyone had any ideas. Right now I am fine
running 5.9.12. I have tried the earliest RPM I can find which is
fetchmail-5.9.13-1.i386.rpm and it has the same problems.  Output from
both the working and non-working versions is included below.
