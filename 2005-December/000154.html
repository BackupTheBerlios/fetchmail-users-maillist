Good to see that the word is spreading. :-)

&gt;<i> Due to the advent of spamassassin, I am no longer able to accept lots
</I>&gt;<i>of messages at once via fetchmail -- it causes my laptop to thrash.  I
</I>
My personal experience is that SpamAssassin's biggest hog is its Bayes
database, disabling it speeds up SA quite a bit. External filters such
as bogofilter, spamprobe or qsf are much faster than SpamAssassin, and
as you are already using procmail, integration is quite easy.

It takes a bit of manual work training the filter, though. Also, if you
use &quot;spamassassin&quot; in your procmail script, consider running a &quot;spamd&quot;
daemon and then use &quot;spamc&quot; in your script instead, this also gives you
some resource control given proper spamd settings.

You can also use a procmail &quot;local lock file&quot; to make sure only one
spamassassin process is running at a time, and you can also precede the
spamassassin line with &quot;nice&quot;. (You'd change your &quot;:0fw&quot; rule to
&quot;:0fw:.spamassassin.lock&quot; or similar, depending on how _exactly_ you use
spamassassin.)

&gt;<i>use sendmail -&gt; procmail -&gt; spamassassin, so using sendmail's load
</I>&gt;<i>average limit didn't really help the situation, since sendmail has no
</I>&gt;<i>idea it's kicked off a bunch of spamassassin processes that in a few
</I>&gt;<i>seconds will drive the load way up. (In this analysis I'm assuming that
</I>&gt;<i>it's only cpu time and not disk I/O which is causing the problem.)
</I>
The actual problem is that sendmail is somewhat limited in terms of
resource control. With Postfix for instance you'd set the
local_concurrency_limit to some low value and that's it, but as shown
above there are ways around your problem.

&gt;<i>  --fetchlimitsize n (kilobytes, default to 100 kilobytes? 1 meg?)
</I>&gt;<i>  --expungesize n (kilobytes, same default as fetchlimitsize)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In addition, we could use a rate limiter sending messages to sendmail
</I>&gt;<i> to dodge the spamassassin problem. My laptop takes 2 cpu seconds to
</I>&gt;<i> spamassassin a small email message (20 seconds elapsed) and so perhaps
</I>&gt;<i> a time-based measure with an optional addition for the message size
</I>&gt;<i> would do it. If you wanted to be clever you could compute this
</I>&gt;<i> dynamically by watching what happens when you throw a bunch of email
</I>&gt;<i> messages at sendmail, but to start:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  --mtacpu n (seconds, default to 0)
</I>&gt;<i>  --mtacpupermeg n (seconds per megabyte, default to 0)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> so fetchmail would wait &quot;mtacpu + size / 1meg * mtacpupermeg&quot; seconds
</I>&gt;<i> before sending another message to the MTA. I'd set this to 2. Hm,
</I>&gt;<i> given that this value is small a floating-point value would be a
</I>&gt;<i> good idea instead of an integer.
</I>
As you talked about varying network connection quality, a time limit is
probably one easy way to go and it makes good sense for --expunge* like
options, too -- fetchmail might then checkpoint the mailbox every two
minutes or so (or whichever the user set).
