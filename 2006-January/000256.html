The problem disappeared as suddenly after it appeared. Well, till
today at least, because now exactly the same problem started again.

It seems to happen on all messages, deleting the message which causes
the problem, just makes it halt on the next message.

I cannot understand why it works fine so lang, and then it starts to
go mad like this. Another e-mail account I have from the same ISP,
works still fine.

Also something which is not yet clear to me: is it a problem that my
ISP's POP3 server is giving wrong info about the size of the mail to
fetchmail, or is it my own local MTA that complains that the e-mail it
receives is not the size fetchmail said it is? In the first case, it
would not matter much which MTA I am using locally?

Adding forcerc did not help.

My own setup: exim 4.50 from Debian Sarge (using sa-exim and clamav,
but that should not matter much). Problem happens with both Sarge's
fetchmail 6.2.5-12sarge3 and recompiled 6.3.1-4 from unstable.

# fetchmail -V
fetchmail: WARNING: Running as root is discouraged.
This is fetchmail release 6.3.1+NTLM+SDPS+SSL+NLS
Fallback MDA: (none)
Linux Luna 2.6.14-cks4 #1 Wed Nov 9 16:10:51 CET 2005 i686 GNU/Linux
Taking options from command line
No mailservers set up -- perhaps /root/.fetchmailrc is missing?


Is not there simply a way to make it *ignore* this problem? Actually
fetchmail is completely unusable to me now, as I cannot access my
e-mail anymore :-(
