They replied :-)

They were intrigued, and they are sending an email to the server people 
&quot;above&quot; so that they study it. Meanwhile, they close my side of my report, 
because they, as entry level support people, can do nothing. That is fine 
with me, more helpful than what I expected.

They said that perhaps the server people might contact me one day, they 
don't know. They did not like too much that I mentioned &quot;Linux&quot;, because 
they asked where had I got the logs from. So I said I also had problems 
with another Windows machine which I seldom use, so they were pacified :-)


I have to thank you people again for your help - I did not know what was 
happening, nor did I notice the match on it always being the same machine 
that failed. With that information I had something reliable to contact the 
ISP support.
