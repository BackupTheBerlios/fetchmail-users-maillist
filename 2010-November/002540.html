What the eyes do not see, the heart does not feel - I mean, I said I 
had problems in windows too, which is not exactly true ;-)


If the issue ever reaches the server people at my ISP, I know they will 
not flinch at the word &quot;linux&quot;, because I believe they use it. Unix, 
windows, linux... probably a mixture. I have worked for that company, so I 
know ;-)
