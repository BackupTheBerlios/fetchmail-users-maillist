Hi Carlos,

I guess it's just less noticable in Thunderbird.  I've often found that it masks
issues you see with other software, and later silently recovers.

I cannot see anything wrong with fetchmail, it's just making strikingly obvious
that their load balancing rig isn't configured properly by propagating an error
message Thunderbird would only log to a file in debug mode, see
&lt;<A HREF="https://wiki.mozilla.org/MailNews:Logging">https://wiki.mozilla.org/MailNews:Logging</A>&gt; - the log file should reveal the
same problem once in a while.


In your situation, there are very few recourses:

1. try somehow getting through to their tech support, and tell 1st and 2nd level
support that you've already discussed with them for hours without them being
able to fix, and get you *tech* support rather than talking through their
1st-level-support decision trees.  I know it's hard, and they will frequently
violate their contracts in the process. See #3 below.

2. talk to their press department instead of the tech support, possibly teaming
up with a computer magazine or radio station to make a story of it.

3. talk to their legal department instead of the tech support and demand that
they keep their contracts

4. cancel your plans and switch ISP.  You may want to do this right away if
you're already fed up :)


Technically, the error response you're getting is in response to an
authentication attempt and reveals that their front-end proxy and their real
IMAP back-end server aren't on talking grounds.  There's nothing you can do,
technically, other than to retry until it works.

Sorry!
