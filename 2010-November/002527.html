OK, I could weasel myself out and pick the nit that &quot;it failed because we didn't
even try&quot;, but of course the error message is misleading/irritating to the user,
and the extra round trip for the NOOP probe is no good spending.

Thanks a bunch. I've read it, test compiled it, then applied and pushed it.  I
haven't fully tested all cases yet.

I don't currently like the CAPA handling too much (even though I've myself laid
hands on it a couple of months or years ago) because the program logic isn't
easy to read, but I need to think more about how it should be done right before
I'll do something about it, and frankly, it's doesn't have a high priority for
the next few weeks.
