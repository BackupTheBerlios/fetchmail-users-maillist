You are right... good catch!

    Interesting that they haven't noticed themselves: these things are
    discovered by watching the stats of failures. Maybe their ISP side is not
    that good: I have seen those stats on the phone side of the business,
    they were investigated.


Unfortunately, my logs only have three such detailed attempts, as the 
&quot;decoded as &lt;&gt;&quot; line is only printed when fetchmail is called &quot;-vv&quot;, and I 
usually use &quot;-v&quot;. For those few entries I have, you are right, the ctmmp4 
machine is the one failing. I have changed my fetchmail call to -vv 
inmediately. And yes, that machine continues to fail:

<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/fetchmail-users">cer at Telcontar</A>:~&gt; cat /var/log/mail-20101109 /var/log/mail | grep fetchmail | grep -B 6 &quot;NO you are not allowed to act as a proxy server&quot; | grep &quot;decoded as&quot;
Nov  9 13:16:20 Telcontar fetchmail[9772]: decoded as &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/fetchmail-users">6F... at ctmmp4.adm.correo</A>&gt;

Do you think I could decode these lines (below), from logs? I could them compare 
two months of logs and check the pattern with grep and a script:

Nov 10 13:44:02 Telcontar fetchmail[4520]: IMAP&gt; A0003 AUTHENTICATE CRAM-MD5
Nov 10 13:44:02 Telcontar fetchmail[4520]: IMAP&lt; + PE...ZW8+



&gt;<i> [The patch below is unrelated to your issue, it is only based on an
</I>&gt;<i> unrelated section of your logs]

:<i>-)

Glad to have been of help, somehow :-)
