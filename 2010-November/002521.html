Thanks for your prompt response: now I understand what is happening. Your 
last paragraph explains it:

&gt;<i> Technically, the error response you're getting is in response to an
</I>&gt;<i> authentication attempt and reveals that their front-end proxy and their real
</I>&gt;<i> IMAP back-end server aren't on talking grounds.  There's nothing you can do,
</I>&gt;<i> technically, other than to retry until it works.
</I>
So, it is not that the say my fetchmail is a proxy server, but rather, 
that their own imap proxy server is not on good terms with their own imap 
server! Then indeed, nothing can be done, technically, from our side.

At least, I know now, thanks :-)

I will simply retrigger mail fetching, and wait.


As to the rest of your email... I prefer to stay with my known can of 
worms, ie, not change isp. I will try what you say about getting the log 
from thunderbird: see if the message there is different, google for it, 
find if more people is affected, and perhaps try to find a support forum 
or mail to send them the complaint - the first level people do not like 
the word &quot;linux&quot;, perhaps &quot;thunderbird&quot; gets a chance. They once told me 
the only support mail problems with outlook or their webmail... thus a 
systematic problem like bounces can't be solved. They get solved, 
eventually, but no way to report.

Which is funny, as I worked some time for them and I know for a fact they 
have linux servers! :-)  But I don't have current contacts there. Pity.


Thanks for your response, it has clarified the situation.
