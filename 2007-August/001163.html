I only have the source for 6.3.8 to hand.  It's possible this feature
is relatively recent.  It may also be that there's something else
happening to the value of the hostname beforehand - certainly lots of
software relies on resolver libraries, which can be tripped up by
having your hostname against the loopback address.

I'd advise that, if you can, you create a second line with JUST the
hostname in it, and the real IP of the host.

Checking the source it looks like the hostname passed is based off of
the value of id_me in sink.c.  The value of that depends on whether
&quot;set invisible&quot; is on (which I use).

That may be set to the value of fetchmailhost, which defaults to
localhost, but is later over-ridden by the DNS name of the host using
gethostname.

It may also default to value of server.truename, and I'm not enough of
a C programmer to work out where that comes from :)

However, an upgrade to 6.3.8 should at least confirm whether or not
this is actually no longer a problem.

</I>&gt;<i> until the problem is solved via fetchmail also because... I'm learning
</I>&gt;<i> more about fetchmail this afternoon, thanks to this thread, than by
</I>&gt;<i> reading the docs again and again...
</I>
As long as you're willing to put up my direct approach, I'm sure we'll
get there :)
