</I>This happened to me just once before, about three years ago.  I had looked for 
the missing emails in what I remembered to be the place I found them last 
time, but things have moved on :-)

&gt;<i> It's also worth saying that any time there are problems with mail
</I>&gt;<i> to/from a list it's worth checking any archive of that list to see if
</I>&gt;<i> mail is reaching it, and if others are replying.  It's also worth
</I>&gt;<i> trying contacting the list administrators via the -owner address (in
</I>&gt;<i> this case fetchmail-users-owner@), which you did indirectly do in this
</I>&gt;<i> case ;)
</I>
If the faulty recipe had been earlier in the queue, I'd have realised that 
messages were missing from many folders, and found the problem much quicker.  
Just the way it goes, I guess.  I hadn't thought of checking the archives, 
though, and that's a really stupid oversight.
