I do have 'good' email providers - two, in fact.  You are mistaken, too, in 
your comments about gmail.  I always receive, forwarded to me for reading in 
kmail, copies of all messages I send to lists.  The reason I use gmail for 
lists is quite simple - they manage to trap about half of the spam that comes 
through.  Yes, I need to check their spam pages quite often, but there are 
few false-positives - I'd say about one in 200 at most.

Thanks for trying to help, but it wasn't gmail's fault.
