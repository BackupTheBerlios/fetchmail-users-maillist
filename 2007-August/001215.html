I call this one FUD.

It isn't either well known, or documented (that I've ever found).  I
too am on GMail and I've never yet not received any email.  I *have*
seen quite a few list emails arrive in Junk however, until the system
is trained.

Now Hotmail, it *IS* documented that for Hotmail emails that MS view
as &quot;junk&quot; are often just dropped on the floor.  I've even confirmed
this myself, more than once.

The most important things here are:

1) Both Anne and I are on GMail, I'm seeing the emails fine
2) I've CCd Anne on 2 emails and emailed her direct on 2 - she hasn't
responded to or seen any of these

I'm strongly of the opinion that Anne is neglecting to check her Junk
mail folder.  I'll be trying a non GMail account to contact her later.
