Well, I have a separate admin mailbox that all mail for a number of
admin related addresses goes to (postmaster, hostmaster, abuse and the
others mentioned by an RFC I don't remember the number of).  I've also
got a catchall mailbox for last resort delivery - it almost never
receives mail, but it has come in handy a few times.

Lastly, I use Hobbit (hobbitmon.sf.net) to monitor all my systems,
including logfile monitoring.  It's the work of a few moments to set
it to produce an alert when fetchmail generates an error message.
Just make sure it sends emails to an off-network mailbox as well as to
a local one, so that if you break your local mailbox you still get
notified (and visit the web page so you can eyeball the status in case
you completely break your email).

&gt;<i> Thanks for all the advice and help btw ;-)
</I>
I'm happy to help those who're willing to work towards a solution and
provide the information asked for :)
