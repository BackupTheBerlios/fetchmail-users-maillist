How you can conceivably make a connection between the acronym FUD and
the situation at hand is beyond me. Anyway, back to our regularly
scheduled discussion.

1) Check out this URL:

<A HREF="https://mail.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?answer=10314&amp;topic=1566">https://mail.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?answer=10314&amp;topic=1566</A>

Why your quest failed to turn it up is a mystery.

2) Where is this 'HOTMAIL' documentation? I am not a friend of Hotmail
as a rule; however, I have experience far greater success with it than
Google's lame offering. At Least IMHO, it exceeds GMail in it
fuctionability.

3) The use of 'recent' in GMail will result in the user receiving a
copy of every message that they send. Are you employing this technique?
If you are not familiar with the 'recent' tag in GMail, Google for it.
If you still cannot find it, contact me.

For the record, I reiterate that her problem exists due to her
reliance on a substandard web email system.
