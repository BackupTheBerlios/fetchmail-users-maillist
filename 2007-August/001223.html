Hey, at least you've learned to check the destination of last resort.
It's something that's worth checking regularly and, along with your
mail log, is something worth checking any time things seem to be going
wrong.

It's also worth saying that any time there are problems with mail
to/from a list it's worth checking any archive of that list to see if
mail is reaching it, and if others are replying.  It's also worth
trying contacting the list administrators via the -owner address (in
this case fetchmail-users-owner@), which you did indirectly do in this
case ;)
