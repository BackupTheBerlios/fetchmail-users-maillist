It probably wouldn't, but I don't know all the changes that have gone
into fetchmail in the interim.

&gt;<i> I take this to mean that setting smtpaddress as above isn't enough to

</I>&gt;<i> and if yes, isn't there any other way to make fetchmail helo something

</I>
Right, having taken a moment to dive into the code, the value of the
HELO/ELHO string that is presented is the value of smtphost.  This
defaults to localhost - change this to the fully qualified name of the
host and ensure that it is configured to NOT reject connections that
provide it's own name as the HELO value.

Note that rejecting unqualified HELO values while being fully RFC
compliant will trip up a large number of MUAs (particularly those from
Microsoft).  If you don't expect any mail clients to ever connect
directly you'll probably be ok.

&gt;<i> Generally, I have no problem at all to study man pages. The specific
</I>&gt;<i> problem I have with email related docs is that it's really hard to
</I>&gt;<i> figure out, unless one already knows the whole terminology and protocols
</I>&gt;<i> in advance, to know what to search for.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Even placing the whole error message in google, as I usually do, doesn't
</I>&gt;<i> yeld much when email is concerned. I know this for a fact, that's why I
</I>&gt;<i> also need a bit of pointers from mailing lists.
</I>
Which is why I went directly to the postfix site for that snippet, and
I don't even use postfix :)
