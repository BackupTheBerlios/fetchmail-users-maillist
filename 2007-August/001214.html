You do seem to be having a great deal of trouble; however, I am unsure
as to what you are specifically referring to. All of the messages that
you have sent have been received. At least it would appear to be so.
Why do you think they are not?

Are you failing to receive a copy of the message you sent returned to
you via this group? If that is the problem, and I think it is, and you
you are using GMail, and your address would indicates that you are,
then that is your problem. Google had decreed that you do not have
that right. When you send a message to a forum such as this, Google
will not place that message in your in-box when it is relayed by the
forum you sent the message to. It conveniently loses it. This is a
well know and documented feature(?) of Google's email system.

Might I suggest that you get a real email provider. Why not simply use
your ISP's email service for starters. In any event, lose GMail. They
are the worst service around. They even make 'Hotmail' look good.
Actually, the new version &lt;<A HREF="http://get.live.com/">http://get.live.com/</A>&gt; isn't all that bad
when compared to GMail.
