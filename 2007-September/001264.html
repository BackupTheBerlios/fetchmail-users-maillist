Allow me to add my 2&#162; here. I have always found Google's
implementation of POP and SMTP to be extremely poorly thought out.
Quite frankly, the entire concept of Google's email service is subject
to extreme scrutiny. Google has even started a pay service that is so
pathetic that if Microsoft had attempted to offer a similar deal to the
general public, they would be sued for fraud.

I believe it is in everybody's interest to simple abandon Google and
it's email service until they become a more rules compliant service.
