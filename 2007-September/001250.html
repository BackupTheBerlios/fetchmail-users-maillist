That reason is unfortunately a design flaw, in that the former
maintainer believed it were sufficient to track &quot;I've seen this message&quot;
on the server side. This is based on the assumption that fetchmail were
the only software accessing your mailbox, evidently untrue in your case,
and in many more cases, too. You need client-side tracking, which
fetchmail cannot currently do for IMAP. It's on the TODO list for the
next major release though, but resources are very limited.

&gt;<i> It only downloads the &quot;unseen&quot; messages. What I would like is to
</I>&gt;<i> download any message that *this* computer hasn't seen, even the ones
</I>&gt;<i> I've already read on my Windows machines.
</I>
This is not yet implemented in fetchmail unfortunately. The patches that
are available are also not sufficient in that they are agnostic of the
&quot;UIDVALIDITY&quot;.

If you're just fetching messages from the INBOX, you may have more luck
with POP3 + UIDL (the latter is important and not the default
unfortunately).

&gt;<i> Is there a way to accomplish this?
</I>
Not in fetchmail. Sorry for that.
