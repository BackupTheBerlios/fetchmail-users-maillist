I might actually suggest that any time fetchmail connects to a
POP/IMAP server that has known problems it should generate a warning.
I'm sure this would cover more than just GMail's unexpected
implementation (from a quick glance at the FAQ).

</I>
Don't disagree in the slightest, I was just pointing out that GMail at
least doesn't appear to be breaking RFCs, whereas I believe Hotmail
does by silently dropping email after accepting it.

&gt;<i> I see Anne's posting of getting around the Google POP3 interface and still
</I>&gt;<i> have some benefits, but this doesn't bring the whole discussion back into
</I>&gt;<i> the scope of this list I'm afraid...
</I>
I agree, I was just attempting to point out that while GMail's POP3
interface may come with a major POLA violation, I don't agree with
Gerard's perspective.  I'm also not certain that the email that
started this divergence actually has GMail's quirks at the heart of it
(it looks probable that the problem is that the end-user has
configured fetchmail to only download 5 messages at a time).
