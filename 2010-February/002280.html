You get what you pay for. AFAIR web.de allows mail forwards to other addresses,
which is a nice way to bypass storage quota.

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> (That the last two header lines are only terminated with \n instead of
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> \r\n is only a minor problem, albeit a little obscure.)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Not only that. Given that your fetchmail was talking IMAP, and it asked for just
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the header, imap.web.de already goofed up and shipped a body line as part of the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> header... Whoops!
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Nope, it just follows RFC 822: &quot;[the body] is separated from the headers
</I>&gt;<i> by a null line  (i.e.,  a line with nothing preceding the CRLF.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> The IMAP server simply outputs everything up to the first empty line
</I>&gt;<i> when the headers are requested.
</I>
RFC 5322 (the successor to 822) also states, quote:

&quot;2.2.  Header Fields

   Header fields are lines beginning with a field name, followed by a
   colon (&quot;:&quot;), followed by a field body, and terminated by CRLF.  A
   field name MUST be composed of printable US-ASCII characters (i.e.,
   characters that have values between 33 and 126, inclusive), except
   colon.  [...]&quot;

Quite obviously the web.de server does *not* conform to RFC-5322, so you can't
invoke RFC-5322 here.

&gt;&gt;<i> Their systems are faulty, so? It's in their own and commercial interest to fix,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> but why would I waste time on workounds to that others can go about their
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> commercials? I see no incentive.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> When is a strip of blanks:
</I>&gt;<i> ...
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Any more decent heuristics and lookahead to guess the answer to the questions
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not asking for heuristics, only for resilience and robustness.
</I>&gt;<i> Ignoring anything we don't like (read &quot;skipping invalid header lines&quot;)
</I>&gt;<i> is surely the way to go, not being a pedantic RFC validator.
</I>
&gt;&gt;<i> And in order to avoid allegations that fetchmail were corrupting messages, when
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> in fact the upstream or the sender or some router spoiled the message, the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> original fetchmail has refused to fetch such messages.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I don't think the development is marketing-driven, where allegations are
</I>&gt;<i> more relevant than facts and functionality.
</I>
Only to have the next person blame fetchmail because it discards the invalid
header line? No thanks. We can't win, see below.

I'd considered a heuristic like &quot;line with only whitespace followed by invalid
header&quot;, but even that might truncate the header prematurely...

Consider:

&quot;Subject: blah\r\n
    \r\n
fasel\r\n&quot;

and:

&quot;Sender: <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/fetchmail-users">blah at example.org</A>\r\n
    \r\n
This is some MIME prolog and syntactically part of the body\r\n&quot;


The former might have been the mistaken attempt at folding &quot;Subject: blah
fasel&quot;, and the latter a b0rked template for a mail merge.  It really needs to
be refused by the upstream server. There's no way for fetchmail to disambiguate
both.

It'd be nice if someone wrote the code with proper options to have some kind of:

handle-invalid-headers: {method}

Where method is one of the following:

- skip-message: does what we have now,

- pass-invalid-message-verbatim: would ignore the corruption and disable the
check as proposed by Fr&#233;d&#233;ric Marchal,

- escape-offending-line: prefix it with X-Fetchmail-Invalid-Header: (You'd get
two in this situation, the blank one and the MIME prolog line) - note this may
need proper escaping, and

- terminate-header: insert the required blank line to delineate header and body.

- drop-offending-line: would kill the invalid line as in your proposal

I'd prefer skip-messsage over escape-... over any other options.

This is a lot of work just to make up because someone else goofed up his part.
There's more important work to do in fetchmail than working around broken
servers, like bugfixing.


Feel free to clone from the shiny new Git repository and hack on a new topic
branch. I'll be happy to review and comment on the code and give hints, but I'm
not doing the implementation.

&gt;&gt;<i> I am well aware of Fr&#233;d&#233;ric's reiterations that for him it's safe to just
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> disable the check (by modifying source code) and forwarding such malformatted
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Ok, I just looked that up, I should have guessed that I'm not the first
</I>&gt;<i> one running into this problem. :)
</I>
Nevermind.

&gt;<i> I just disabled the refuse_mail line like Frederic did back then and now
</I>&gt;<i> fetching goes through like it should. (And removed the check for
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;outlevel &gt;= O_VERBOSE&quot;, so such events are logged, at least, although
</I>&gt;<i> there is no account information, so it does not help that much).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I don't understand [what] should go wrong with disabling refuse_mail and
</I>&gt;<i> why silently skipping is better than ignoring non-fatal errors, but as I
</I>&gt;<i> can see this was discussed before and I really don't want to reraise old
</I>&gt;<i> topics.
</I>
If the downstream MTA is picky, it refuses the mail and fetchmail gets the blame
-- as the messenger between two other parts of the system, it often gets the
blame when the downstream refuses what the upstream should have rejected in the
first place.

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> - Wouldn't it be better to ignore invalid header lines? And if such a
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> error happens, the error message should be printed even with --silent set.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Does that imply that you don't get this complaint in --silent mode?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Have you been using 6.3.13 or 6.3.14?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 6.3.14. There's a check for outlevel in transact.c:590.
</I>
Eww. Thanks.
