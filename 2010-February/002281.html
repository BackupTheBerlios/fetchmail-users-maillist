<PRE>Matthias Andree, 2010-02-08 20:55:

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Not only that. Given that your fetchmail was talking IMAP, and it asked for just
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> the header, imap.web.de already goofed up and shipped a body line as part of the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> header... Whoops!
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Nope, it just follows RFC 822: &quot;[the body] is separated from the headers
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> by a null line  (i.e.,  a line with nothing preceding the CRLF.&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The IMAP server simply outputs everything up to the first empty line
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> when the headers are requested.
</I>&gt;<i> RFC 5322 (the successor to 822) also states, quote:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;2.2.  Header Fields
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>    Header fields are lines beginning with a field name, followed by a
</I>&gt;<i>    colon (&quot;:&quot;), followed by a field body, and terminated by CRLF.  A
</I>&gt;<i>    field name MUST be composed of printable US-ASCII characters (i.e.,
</I>&gt;<i>    characters that have values between 33 and 126, inclusive), except
</I>&gt;<i>    colon.  [...]&quot;
</I>
What do you expect the IMAP server to do? Apply some magic to the
headers? Or barf and abort like fetchmail does? Surely not.
The IMAP server does the only reasonable thing: Just ignore the
malformed header line.
Btw, my local dovecot does just the same. My guess is that most other
IMAP servers also do.

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> And in order to avoid allegations that fetchmail were corrupting messages, when
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> in fact the upstream or the sender or some router spoiled the message, the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> original fetchmail has refused to fetch such messages.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I don't think the development is marketing-driven, where allegations are
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> more relevant than facts and functionality.
</I>&gt;<i> Only to have the next person blame fetchmail because it discards the invalid
</I>&gt;<i> header line? No thanks. We can't win, see below.
</I>
I never said anything about &quot;discard&quot;. Just pass it on as-is.

&gt;<i> I'd considered a heuristic like &quot;line with only whitespace followed by invalid
</I>&gt;<i> header&quot;, but even that might truncate the header prematurely...
</I>
Really, there's no need for heuristics here. Too much magic is not good.

&gt;<i> It'd be nice if someone wrote the code with proper options to have some kind of:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> handle-invalid-headers: {method}
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Where method is one of the following:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - skip-message: does what we have now,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - pass-invalid-message-verbatim: would ignore the corruption and disable the
</I>&gt;<i> check as proposed by Fr&#233;d&#233;ric Marchal,
</I>
These two should really be enough. The three others require extra coding
which is not worth the hassle.
I'll do it when I have the time (probably not in the next few weeks).
For now, the patch is ok for me, but I don't want to keep that for ever.

&gt;&gt;<i> I don't understand [what] should go wrong with disabling refuse_mail and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> why silently skipping is better than ignoring non-fatal errors, but as I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> can see this was discussed before and I really don't want to reraise old
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> topics.
</I>&gt;<i> If the downstream MTA is picky, it refuses the mail and fetchmail gets the blame
</I>&gt;<i> -- as the messenger between two other parts of the system, it often gets the
</I>&gt;<i> blame when the downstream refuses what the upstream should have rejected in the
</I>&gt;<i> first place.
</I>
Sure, but currently fetchmail does not even leave a chance to the
downstream *DA, so it is to blame anyway. What can we possibly lose if
we pass the mail?
- If downstream accepts (as most xDAs will), so the MUA is left to do
the magic, and they are usually well prepared.
- If the downstream rejects, we can leave it on the upstream server and
log the event, just like we do it right now.
