Hi Uli,

that is a misunderstanding.  Sorry for the unclear misleading documentation (not
mine - this was inherited from ESR's fetchmail RELEASE_1-9a/RELEASE_1-9-0 from
October 1996).

After a bit of code research of current post-6.3.14 Git code, &quot;target user&quot; here
means, in the order of priority (earlier wins over those listed later), the
associated user id of:

- the contents of the FETCHMAILUSER environment variable
- the contents of the LOGNAME environment variable (supposed to be set upon login)
- the contents of the USER variable
- whatever user is associated with what the getuid() call returns.

Note that some failures (non-existing users in particular) will silently map
back to root. :-(

(Git details: commit 30ac0cb6 aka. RELEASE_1-9a~16 i. e. 16 commits before
RELEASE_1-9a, or 28 commits past RELEASE_1-8-0)

Note that whoami or who am i may be misleading, better use id -u or id -un.

Now, if you run fetchmail as root, you may have root as LOGNAME or USER, or
getuid() will return 0, and thus the MDA will run as root (check: env | egrep -w
'LOGNAME|USER|FETCHMAILUSER' ; id -urn)

Implicit behaviour thus depends a bit on how exactly you obtain root privileges
- su, sudo (and the respective options for full login or not)

The easiest solution would be to override FETCHMAILUSER to the desired user, or
to use an mda that can switch UID by itself if run as root. Maildrop and
procmail can do that in &quot;delivery mode&quot; (if -d %T are in fetchmail's mda option).

I'll see to improving the documentation for the nonce; in the long run we'll
have to fix this.

There's a reason why I let fetchmail whine about being run as root user.

It's probably better to configure maildrop properly and install it as
setuid-root (note that few tools are designed to support this safely), and then
run fetchmail as some unprivileged user.

HTH
