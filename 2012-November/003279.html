<PRE>&gt;<i> There is more than half a dozen places where a new option needs to be
</I>&gt;<i> implemented, tested, documented, and thereabouts, in fetchmail's code
</I>&gt;<i> and documentation, let alone discussing this :)
</I>
&gt;<i> unlike your earlier suggestion of ...
</I>
?, so you're suggesting support of multiple fingerprint / additional hash
function mechanism is easier to implement than --password? That's
news to me. But ok, fine, you have a deal... give me multiple fingerprint
options and I'll shut up about --password :-) For now ;)

&gt;<i> suggestion (talking in many months now) of &quot;multiple server certificates
</I>&gt;<i> for SSL/TLS&quot;.
</I>
<A HREF="http://developer.berlios.de/bugs/?func=detailbug&amp;bug_id=16000&amp;group_id=1824">http://developer.berlios.de/bugs/?func=detailbug&amp;bug_id=16000&amp;group_id=1824</A>

I interceded in bug 16000 over three years ago to stop the ridiculous
assertion that 'sslfingerprint is unnecessary and should therefore be
removed.' And I still have an unsent draft to correct the idea of 20090819
that fingerprints aren't needed to detect mitm attacks. Though given
20100409 it would be supportive to that effect. Certainly all the 'news'
and ssl observatories these days are as well.

&gt;&gt;<i> Instead of providing a missing item and/or being a per item override to the rc,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> -f *is* the exclusive rc. Writing the per invocation rc via pipe isn't
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> really ideal either.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Why not?  Because it deviates from your favourite?
</I>
No. I thought this was covered already. Because forcing all --password
inquirers to write middleware is inefficient and error prone for them.
Certainly more wtf's/grr's will come from that than their simply supplying
--password on the command line.

&gt;&gt;<i> It's also a binary which, with some platforms or shells, may work in a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> preferred or required manner to the builtin.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> True enough.  I still do not buy the argument that it is considerably
</I>&gt;<i> more effort to write an rc file than to write a command line.  We are
</I>&gt;<i> talking about convenience here.
</I>
Let's see...

my convenience store way
 cat uplist | while read u p ; do fm -f all_but_u_p_template -u $u -p $p ; done

current fm provided way for users
 cat uplist | while read u p ; do
  figure out how to quote quotes and $ and things with echo/printf/cat &lt;&lt;eof
  write and debug that
  generate an rc
  fm -f rc
 done
 rescript and generate a new rc for the next variant batch run of accounts.

Add in the thousands of accounts across a few templates and
--p is the simpler unix solution.

I also need to go parallel and get rid of the
 'can't check mail while another fetchmail to same host is running'.

There is a blurb about fetchmail prompting for a password,
that might be stdin'able, though not as nice as --password.

I also have poll argument bastardized as noted in a former post :)
