You should find related postings in the list archive.

There's nothing wrong with your approach, though I'd suggest
staggering the polls as just good manners.  Each individual can have
their own config file, and the startup script would run it as them.

Something like the following would start fetchmail for any user with a
config file (caution, not run, just written off the top of my head for
this email):

#!/bin/bash
BASE=/home
FETCHMAIL_ARGS=&quot;&quot;
for DIR in /home/*
do UNAME=`basename ${DIR}`
  if [ ${DIR}/.fetchmailrc ]; then
    su - ${USER} -c &quot;fetchmail ${FETCHMAIL_ARGS}&quot;
  fi
done

Polished, tested, examples have been posted to the list in the past,
or the above can be fitted into a standard startup/shutdown script for
your OS of choice.
