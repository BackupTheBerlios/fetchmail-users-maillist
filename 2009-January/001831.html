<PRE>Hi Dan,

I allow myself a public reply since your information seems non-sensitive
and you seem to mean asking this in public.

&gt;<i> Hope 2009 has been good thus far!
</I>
If you consider &quot;chicken pox&quot; at adult age &quot;good&quot; ;-)

&gt;<i> Am I correct in thinking you are the current maintainer of fetchmail?
</I>
You are.

&gt;<i> There never seems to be anyone in #fetchmail on freenode and I've
</I>
I never bother to lurk IRC channels for lack of time.

&gt;<i> tried posting the following question to the freenode-user mailing list
</I>&gt;<i> but it either didn't get approved or my mails weren't received. If you
</I>&gt;<i> can't help or don't have time to help I'd appreciate if you could
</I>&gt;<i> forward this to the list please- thanks!
</I>
The fetchmail-users@ list, if you had that in mind, requires you to be
subscribed if you want to post.

&gt;<i> I'm trying to configure fetchmail under opensuse 11.0 to act as MRA
</I>&gt;<i> for citadel, with Citadel being used to admin mail accounts and also
</I>&gt;<i> most likely as the web GUI for people not using outlook/thunderbird.
</I>
I know next to nothing of Citadel. openSUSE sounds more familiar.

&gt;<i> to is a domainpop/ multidrop server. Reading the fetchmail man page I
</I>&gt;<i> notice that we wouldn't be able to get this working properly without
</I>&gt;<i> our mail server including an X-Envelope header but it would seem to me
</I>&gt;<i> that ours does from looking at the mail archives stored on our current
</I>&gt;<i> (ancient NT4 mdaemon) mail server. However, the default fetchmailrc
</I>
Sorry this phrase is unintelligible. You do indeed need a way to let
fetchmail snatch the original envelope recipient header from the
messages it downloads. If your IMAP or POP3 server writes
&quot;X-Envelope-To: <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/fetchmail-users">foo at bar</A>&quot;, then the configuration seems correct.

&gt;<i> With my current fetchmailrc config file (see below), all the mail is
</I>&gt;<i> being sent to the one citadel account, despite having set up another
</I>&gt;<i> user who I have tried sending mail to. That user receives nothing atm.
</I>
Try running fetchmail --nosyslog --nodetach -v -v (perhaps a third -v if
needed) and see if it matches the domain. If not, some &quot;aka
other.doma.in&quot; may help. In your situation, fetchmail will only
recognize

X-Envelope-To: <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/fetchmail-users">SOMELOCALUSER at mailhost.zen.co.uk</A>

(with varying SOMELOCALUSER parts, the rest is matched verbatim).

&gt;<i> I can be pretty sure that the 'smtphost
</I>&gt;<i> /usr/local/citadel/lmtp.socket' line is correct as I was told to
</I>&gt;<i> insert that by the main Citadel developer. Citadel uses lmtp but
</I>&gt;<i> neither he, nor anyone else in #citadel, knew much about setting up
</I>&gt;<i> citadel for multidrop use. He did say that if fetchmail supports it
</I>&gt;<i> then I should be OK. I tried fetchmail with the default 'envelope
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;X-Original-To&quot;' but that also sent all mail to the one user too.
</I>
I think Citadel should be using a regular multi-user multi-account
setup.

&gt;<i> Somebody else on #citadel irc recommended I start the fetchmail daemon
</I>&gt;<i> in debug mode but this is missing under the SuSE build and so maybe I
</I>
No, it's not. You just shove two or three -v options down to fetchmail
via the command line.

&gt;<i> should re-compile fetchmail with debug mode enabled as I've had no
</I>&gt;<i> luck starting fetchmail from the cli?
</I>
You'll not be getting more information that way.

If you can send yourself a test mail to the account you're fetching from
and show such a message as fetchmail would download (or has delivered)
it, that'll help debugging.

If I may, I'd suggest that you subscribe yourself to the fetchmail-users
list (it's verified opt-in aka. double opt-in) and reply there. 
See &lt;<A HREF="http://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/fetchmail-users">http://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/fetchmail-users</A>&gt;.

If it went unnoticed on said list, sorry. Perhaps &quot;Citadel&quot; triggered
some &quot;if stressed, ignore&quot; mode.

HTH
