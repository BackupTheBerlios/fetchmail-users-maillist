Hi Michael,

looks like a sound idea to me - staggered polls, like Rob suggested, may
help keep response times down as you don't usually step on each other's feet.

Fetchmail doesn't support running as a system daemon. It can be made to
work, but I'd discourage that. You can use the daemon mode, make procmail
setuid root, stuffing all account information in one file and then go like:

defaults sslcertck
poll my.isp.example.org user alice42 password foobar is alice here mda
&quot;procmail -d alice&quot;
poll my.isp.example.org user rob67 password raboof is robert here mda
&quot;procmail -d robert&quot;
...

 -- but that's perhaps something that is undesirable, and it creates a
single point of failure for all users, so a &quot;one cron job per user&quot; is IMHO
the better approach for a dozen users.

One scalability warning though: do not keep thousands of messages undeleted
on the POP3 server you are fetching from, fetchmail up to 6.3.9 does not
scale well to thousands of messages, because the UID cache handling is too
simplistic ATM and scales at O(n^2). It could be improved to O(n log n),
and perhaps even beyond with a database, but requires more code changes
that I do not deep urgent.
