Well, I know that there is an ongoing effort to get rid of the
SSL-wrapped service ports, but they are simply not going away just
because someone says so -- I postulate that established SSL-wrapped
services will be around for quite long and new ones will be rolled out.

The key argument for SSL-wrapped service (as opposed to STARTTLS) is
simplicity in implementation, in that it does not require protocol
changes, unlike STARTTLS.

That the channel (data stream, usually TCP) gets shared between
plaintext and ciphered protocol data also exhibited its own host of
problems in STARTTLS that SSL-wrapped implementations are usually immune
to, and requires precise synchronization. See
&lt;<A HREF="http://www.postfix.org/CVE-2011-0411.html">http://www.postfix.org/CVE-2011-0411.html</A>&gt;.

As to the &quot;I would&quot;, implementing SSL-wrapped service is less effort
both on server and client end, because SSL-wrapped doesn't require
/protocol/ changes, and that in turn causes some sites (Alice DSL, GMX,
1&amp;1, web.de to name a few big German ones) offer SSL/TLS, but not
STARTTLS.  And supporting SSL-wrapped connections natively is certainly
more secure than a fragile stunnel setup :-)

&gt;<i> By the way, I consider &quot;local&quot; as any computer on my site-wide network.
</I>&gt;<i> Personally, I think that most users would agree with this
</I>&gt;<i> interpretation. Then again, I have been known to be wrong on a few
</I>&gt;<i> occasions.
</I>
Fetchmail should support both.  Its SMTP/LMTP client as of 6.3.19 is
currently quite limited, and the whole &quot;sink.c/smtp.c&quot; stuff is
scheduled for a major overhaul before the fetchmail 7 release, and there
is lot of piggybacking and overloading and &quot;automatically try something
else&quot; under the hood that make documentation, observation, and
troubleshooting difficult, and have intricate and sometimes undocumented
interdependencies.

The fetchmail 7 rcfile and command line options will have to change a
bit, to be more &quot;talking&quot; and clearer, and I do believe the
intransparent interaction and mingling of --sslproto, --ssl,
--sslfingerprint, --sslcertck options and thereabouts are prime
candidates for a cleanup.
