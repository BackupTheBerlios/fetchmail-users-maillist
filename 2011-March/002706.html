<PRE>Can you please configure your mailer

- not to send HTML mail (this is my guess because I see traces of MIME
part removal in the header -- the list is configured to strip
enriched/HTML/similar markup formats)

- to indent quoted material?

Thank you.  Other comments in line.

OK, then possibly it was HTML markup like B or STRONG that got converted
because /some/ _markup_ like *bold* is rendered even in pure ASCII by
some mailers.

Point taken.  SSL documentation is indeed a very weak part of all
documentation, especially where it comes to certificate handling -- and
I didn't mean to offend anyone.  The message I was trying to convey (but
failed at) was, don't take random third-party material, and I have
indeed asked the author to correct or remove the material in the past
already, evidently it's still up.  It seems to be readily found with one
of the major search engines.

The open question is whether SSL &quot;consumers&quot; such as fetchmail are
supposed to duplicate the effort and document certificate handling
procedures.  Generally my answer would be &quot;no&quot;, but OpenSSL
documentation is rather weak in this regard, too.

I'll dig around to see if I find reasonable X.509 certificate handling
material free on the web; if I don't, then I think I'll have to write it
on my own.

If anyone knows reasonable documents on cert handling, kindly let me
know.  This isn't the first time people have fallen into this pit.

&gt;<i> obviously, i am working with a knowledge/experience base inferior to your
</I>&gt;<i> own, but asking for help seems to indicate something above &quot;not knowing what
</I>&gt;<i> i'm doing&quot;.  i am sincerely trying to learn, so don't see the need for
</I>&gt;<i> invidious comments.
</I>
Right.
