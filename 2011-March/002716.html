Perry Hutchison &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/fetchmail-users">phutchis at windriver.com</A>&gt; articulated:

&gt;<i> &gt; From: Jerry &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/fetchmail-users">fetchmail.user at seibercom.net</A>&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/fetchmail-users">robbticb at wp.pl</A> &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/fetchmail-users">robbticb at wp.pl</A>&gt; articulated:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; how can I forward mails to Exchange 2010 with TLS over Port 587?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ... I have requested that these features be incorporated into
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Fetchmail ... at present I do not believe they are available.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Your only solution as I see it is to configure the Exchange
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; server to not require TLS ...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> IMO this sort of capability does not really belong in fetchmail,
</I>&gt;<i> which -- being a Unix tool -- is supposed to do one thing well.
</I>&gt;<i> Fetchmail's job, which it does very well, is to retrieve mail
</I>&gt;<i> from mailboxes and pass it to another local mail agent for further
</I>&gt;<i> processing (often local delivery).
</I>
I respectfully disagree with your conclusions. Mail servers have and
are increasingly more likely to enforce SMTP Authentication and TLS.
Fetchmail can use SMTP Authentication when delivering mail; however, it
does not as of yet have the ability, at least if I am understanding it
correctly, to use TLS, aka STARTTLS. That would put your statement:
&quot;Fetchmail's job, which it does very well, is to retrieve mail from
mailboxes and pass it to another local mail agent for further
processing (often local delivery).&quot; in direct conflict with that
statement since it is not fully able to deliver mail to servers that
are employing more robust security techniques. Ones that arre fully
RFC approved i might add and have been for quite some time.

Where I become confused, and that is not all that hard to do, is why
Fetchmail can apparently use TLS to fetch mail; but, it cannot use the
same mechanism to deliver mail. I don't understand why. I have also
been told, although I have never personally verified the fact, that
other programs similar to Fetchmail do offer this capability. Even
small utility programs like &quot;Denyhosts&quot;
&lt;<A HREF="http://denyhosts.sourceforge.net/">http://denyhosts.sourceforge.net/</A>&gt;  which I run on my machine fully
supports SMTP Authentication and TLS.

&gt;<i> The solution to the OP's problem is to configure a local SMTP
</I>&gt;<i> forwarder -- another tool which does one job well -- to receive
</I>&gt;<i> the mail from fetchmail and pass it to the Exchange server via
</I>&gt;<i> TLS, queueing it locally if necessary (e.g. when the Exchange
</I>&gt;<i> server is down).  This approach will avoid the problem of having
</I>&gt;<i> to repeatedly retrieve the same mail from the POP3 server due to
</I>&gt;<i> the Exchange server being unavailable for one reason or another.
</I>
This suggestion adds another layer of complexity which requires further
knowledge to correctly setup and the obvious time and energy required
to do so and maintain said software and its dependency's. I am
personally a life time member of the &quot;KISS&quot; principal. Your suggestion,
while workable, runs counter to that philosophy. I have all ready
stated in another post how I worked around Fetchmail's limitation. I
would not rate it as superior to yours, just different and one that I
would have rather not taken..

I might add that this is in no way a condemnation of the Fetchmail
developers. They have created and advanced an excellent product. It is
just a statement of fact as I see it. I certainly do not want to offend
anyone.

Anyway, that is my 2&#162; on the matter.
