The asterisks (stars) don't belong there.

a look at my original email indicates that asterisks were not there and are
not in my .fetchmailrc


For reliability, add the &quot;uidl&quot; option after POP3.

will add that

downloaded the gmail certificates
$ openssl s_client -connect pop.gmail.com:995 -showcerts
saved one certificate as gmail.pem
one as equifax.pem


Don't do that, you evidently don't know what you're doing, and whatever
website proposed to do that, should be taken down.

Where have you read this procedure?


don't know what i'm doing? of course i know what i'm doing. i'm attempting
to install and configure fetchmail in line with the best advice i am able to
discover, while examining the clarity with which the
installation/configuration process is presented.  in line with &quot;the weakest
link&quot; maxim, software is only as good as its documentation.

obviously, i am working with a knowledge/experience base inferior to your
own, but asking for help seems to indicate something above &quot;not knowing what
i'm doing&quot;.  i am sincerely trying to learn, so don't see the need for
invidious comments.

read the procedure at
<A HREF="http://www.axllent.org/docs/networking/gmail_pop3_with_fetchmail">http://www.axllent.org/docs/networking/gmail_pop3_with_fetchmail</A>
let's go take it down!



Solution:

Install and configure the ca-certificates Ubuntu package (through
debconf and select the certs you want to trust) and remove the
sslcertpath option from fetchmail's configuration, fetchmail will then
use OpenSSL's default, and it should work.

what went wrong? I've checked the fetchmail archive and not come up with a
solution to this.


The solution is to download the Equifax certificate (that Google isn't
presenting to clients, because clients need it installed in the trust
store anyways) from a **secure** and **verified** location, check the finger

print, and only then install it.

The ca-certificates package is the easier sidestep though - there, the
Ubuntu packager is supposed to have verified the certs already.
