</I>&gt;<i> Fetchmail can use SMTP Authentication when delivering mail; however, it

</I>&gt;<i> mailboxes and pass it to another local mail agent for further
</I>&gt;<i> processing (often local delivery).&quot; in direct conflict with that

</I>&gt;<i> RFC approved i might add and have been for quite some time.
</I>
I think this kindles fires around the question what is considered
&quot;local&quot;, and multiple interpretations are possible, with different
conclusions/requirements/assumptions:

- if &quot;local&quot; is interpreted as &quot;localhost&quot; (the default SMTP host
setting), then you could assume that 127.0.0.1 and/or ::1 are configured
to accept mail for relay without authentication, SSL/TLS/STARTTLS.

- if &quot;local&quot; is interpreted as &quot;a computer in the site-wide network&quot;,
then indeed TLS capability may become a requirement.

&gt;<i> Where I become confused, and that is not all that hard to do, is why
</I>&gt;<i> Fetchmail can apparently use TLS to fetch mail; but, it cannot use the
</I>&gt;<i> same mechanism to deliver mail. I don't understand why.
</I>
The answer is simple, because nobody has published the code as of yet,
and I personally can say that I haven't written it either.

STARTTLS is protocol-specific, so it's not just &quot;use a different
function to connect&quot; - the latter, however, might give us at least
SSL-wrapped SMTP (typically port 465), but it, too, needs code to be
written so that users can configure it, and code that determines if we
want SSL/TLS-wrapped behaviour or not.  I'd say this goes into fetchmail 7.

&gt;<i> I have also
</I>&gt;<i> been told, although I have never personally verified the fact, that
</I>&gt;<i> other programs similar to Fetchmail do offer this capability. Even
</I>&gt;<i> small utility programs like &quot;Denyhosts&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;<A HREF="http://denyhosts.sourceforge.net/">http://denyhosts.sourceforge.net/</A>&gt;  which I run on my machine fully
</I>&gt;<i> supports SMTP Authentication and TLS.
</I>
Certainly there are packages to support SMTP AUTH and SMTP with STARTTLS
or SSL/TLS-wrapped connections.  msmtp is an open-source package that
you could plug into fetchmail through the &quot;mda&quot; option, as I have
written earlier in this message

&gt;<i> This suggestion adds another layer of complexity which requires further
</I>&gt;<i> knowledge to correctly setup and the obvious time and energy required
</I>&gt;<i> to do so and maintain said software and its dependency's. I am

Indeed - however, security sometimes requires sacrificing...

&gt;<i> personally a life time member of the &quot;KISS&quot; principal. Your suggestion,
</I>&gt;<i> while workable, runs counter to that philosophy. I have all ready
</I>&gt;<i> stated in another post how I worked around Fetchmail's limitation. I
</I>
...the power that combining Unix tools usually provides.

Running tunnels that are created by separate commands often poses
problems as to figuring out if some software, for instance, fetchmail is
using the right tunnel, or if through some hicc-up something else has
claimed the provisioned port - with a non-function in best and stolen
passwords/mail in the worst case.
