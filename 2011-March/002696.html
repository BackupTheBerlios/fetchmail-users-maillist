<PRE>&lt;snip excellent explanation&gt;

&gt;<i> Is that clear, or does that leave further questions open?  I'm
</I>&gt;<i> happy to answer more questions and possibly refine the README.SSL
</I>&gt;<i> and/or FAQ that ships with fetchmail.  This is really important.
</I>
Let me restate my understanding, to see if I have it right:

----

  The problem is not with trusting a server's certificate
  (vs the root certificate which signed it) as such, but with
  authenticating a certificate -- any certificate -- before
  trusting it.  The authentication problem needs to be solved:

  * Whenever the trusted certificate changes (e.g. due to
    expiration).  This will typically happen more frequently
    with server certificates than with root certificates.

  * For each certificate that is to be trusted.  Authenticating
    (and subsequently trusting) a single root certificate covers
    any number of server certificates signed by that root.

  Therefore there is a lot more authentication work involved, with
  attendant opportunities for mistakes and/or use of insecure
  shortcuts, when trusting server certificates than when trusting
  only root certificates.

----

It's clear enough for me, but I'm not the one who needs to be
convinced :(  (I use fetchmail only to retrieve my own mail
from the Exchange server, and I am not the administrator of
either the Exchange server or the machine where I run fetchmail.)

I inquired about installing the signing certificate rather than
directly trusting the server certificate, and haven't heard back
yet.

BTW this is all happening within an intranet, so we are probably
relatively secure WRT MitM attacks.  OTOH they just recently
required everyone to upgrade their authentication protocols to
improve security, so there does seem to be some degree of concern
for such matters.
