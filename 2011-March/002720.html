</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Thanks for your quick reply. I do concur with most of what you have
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; stated. One area in which I do not totally agree is the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;SSL/TLS-wrapped&quot; proposal. That protocol is deprecated. It usually
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; required port 465 I believe (I forget right now). Even Postfix does
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; not by default support that protocol; although, it obviously can be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; made to use it. I believe that the only real user of that protocol
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; was MS Outlook &lt;=2002. All modern MUAs support TLS on port 587
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; which is also supported by RFCs. What I am trying to say is that I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; would certainly not waste anytime on an obsolete/deprecated
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; protocol, especially one not supported by current RFCs. I would
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; first work on making Fetchmail fully TLS (STARTTLS) compliant
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; {Fetchmail 7} before working or wasting time on a dead protocol.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Well, I know that there is an ongoing effort to get rid of the
</I>&gt;<i> SSL-wrapped service ports, but they are simply not going away just
</I>&gt;<i> because someone says so -- I postulate that established SSL-wrapped
</I>&gt;<i> services will be around for quite long and new ones will be rolled
</I>&gt;<i> out.
</I>
SSL over 465 was never supported by any RFC as far as I know. It was
something Microsoft, and I believe Eudora concocted.

While they may invariably be around for awhile, I would question as to
whether new ones would be rolled out. Even pathetic services like GMail
which claim to support SSL on port 465 actually fully support STARTTLS
on 587. However, I will bow to your expertise. If someone wants to
implement a non RFC conforming mail system, I guess there is not much
that can be done about it. However, forcing Fetchmail to conform to the
lowest common denominator does not seem like an advantageous solution
either; although, probably an inevitable one.

&gt;<i> The key argument for SSL-wrapped service (as opposed to STARTTLS) is
</I>&gt;<i> simplicity in implementation, in that it does not require protocol
</I>&gt;<i> changes, unlike STARTTLS.
</I>
I fully agree to a point. Since new code must be written anyway, why
not start with the latest RFC compliant modes and then work on the
deprecated ones? It is my own belief, somewhat supported by surveys,
that obsoleted/deprecated protocols remain in effect simply because
users still support them. Once the support for them dries up, their use
evaporates. In this one respect I give Wietse Venema a lot of credit.
He has refused to make changes to Postfix simply because someone else
is &quot;doing it&quot; in most cases. In fact, he gets rather cranky when
someone suggests that he change his position. I know Postfix can be
configured to support SSL-wrapped; however, he has wisely turned that
off by default. In any case, it was a relic from when Postfix was first
written circa 1999 or there about.

&gt;<i> That the channel (data stream, usually TCP) gets shared between
</I>&gt;<i> plaintext and ciphered protocol data also exhibited its own host of
</I>&gt;<i> problems in STARTTLS that SSL-wrapped implementations are usually
</I>&gt;<i> immune to, and requires precise synchronization. See
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;<A HREF="http://www.postfix.org/CVE-2011-0411.html">http://www.postfix.org/CVE-2011-0411.html</A>&gt;.
</I>
I am fully aware of that notice. US-CERT issued an alert regarding it a
few days ago. You might be interested in this URL if you have not all
ready perused it: <A HREF="http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/555316;">http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/555316;</A> however, to
delay the implementation of true TLS due to a flaw that was only
discovered within the last month or so and has absolutely no proof that
it was in fact ever actually implemented seems like a rather weak
excuse to me. In any case, it appears that &quot;openssl&quot; might implement
the one line change in the code to prevent this problem to begin with.
Plus, several MTAs including Postfix are either immune to the problem
or have all ready implemented fixes.

&gt;<i> As to the &quot;I would&quot;, implementing SSL-wrapped service is less effort
</I>&gt;<i> both on server and client end, because SSL-wrapped doesn't require
</I>&gt;<i> /protocol/ changes, and that in turn causes some sites (Alice DSL,
</I>&gt;<i> GMX, 1&amp;1, web.de to name a few big German ones) offer SSL/TLS, but not
</I>&gt;<i> STARTTLS.  And supporting SSL-wrapped connections natively is
</I>&gt;<i> certainly more secure than a fragile stunnel setup :-)
</I>
I have never been a fan of &quot;stunnel&quot;; however, simply implementing
SSL-wrapped because it is easier sounds rather lame to me also. Perhaps
if those ISPs or whatever were to start being blitzed with complaints
from their users about not supporting modern protocols a change in
their infrastructure might ensue. Then again, that is my own opinion. I
know it can be difficult. It took years for me to get Comcast to
correct a problem. Yahoo, at least before it started using ATT servers,
was not fully compliant either. I have not checked them lately.

Now, since I was referring to how Fetchmail deliverers mail internally,
I don't know if it makes any difference how those ISPs treat STARTTLS
anyway. I know that the servers on our network require SMTP
Authentication as well as STARTTLS on port 587. Due to the fact that
Fetchmail cannot handle STARTTLS, we had to make it optional for port
25 submissions on our internal network. It works, and is probably
secure; however, we had wanted to close off port 25 internally and
require all users to access via port 587 instead.

&gt;<i> &gt; By the way, I consider &quot;local&quot; as any computer on my site-wide
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; network. Personally, I think that most users would agree with this
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; interpretation. Then again, I have been known to be wrong on a few
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; occasions.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Fetchmail should support both.  Its SMTP/LMTP client as of 6.3.19 is
</I>&gt;<i> currently quite limited, and the whole &quot;sink.c/smtp.c&quot; stuff is
</I>&gt;<i> scheduled for a major overhaul before the fetchmail 7 release, and
</I>&gt;<i> there is lot of piggybacking and overloading and &quot;automatically try
</I>&gt;<i> something else&quot; under the hood that make documentation, observation,
</I>&gt;<i> and troubleshooting difficult, and have intricate and sometimes
</I>&gt;<i> undocumented interdependencies.
</I>
Sounds good.

&gt;<i> The fetchmail 7 rcfile and command line options will have to change a
</I>&gt;<i> bit, to be more &quot;talking&quot; and clearer, and I do believe the
</I>&gt;<i> intransparent interaction and mingling of --sslproto, --ssl,
</I>&gt;<i> --sslfingerprint, --sslcertck options and thereabouts are prime
</I>&gt;<i> candidates for a cleanup.
</I>
I totally agree.

In any event and to save yourself a lot of grief from unhappy users, I
would STRONGLY recommend that you put a disclaimer in the man pages,
perhaps elsewhere also, that SSL-wrapped in not on by default in
Postfix and certain other MTAs. If the user is going to go that route
they must be made aware of this fact or else you will inevitably be
getting a barrage of complaints from users wanting to know why they are
having connection problems.

By the way, do you have any idea when a release candidate for
Fetchmail 7 might be available? I am assuming it is a year or so away. I
would be happy to do some beta testing on it. I am getting ready to set
up a PC devoted to testing beta products right now.
