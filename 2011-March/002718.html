</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; how can I forward mails to Exchange 2010 with TLS over Port 587?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt; ... I have requested that these features be incorporated into
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt; Fetchmail ... at present I do not believe they are available.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt; Your only solution as I see it is to configure the Exchange
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt; server to not require TLS ...
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; IMO this sort of capability does not really belong in fetchmail,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; which -- being a Unix tool -- is supposed to do one thing well.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Fetchmail's job, which it does very well, is to retrieve mail
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; from mailboxes and pass it to another local mail agent for further
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; processing (often local delivery).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I respectfully disagree with your conclusions. Mail servers have and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; are increasingly more likely to enforce SMTP Authentication and TLS.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Fetchmail can use SMTP Authentication when delivering mail;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; however, it does not as of yet have the ability, at least if I am
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; understanding it correctly, to use TLS, aka STARTTLS. That would
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; put your statement: &quot;Fetchmail's job, which it does very well, is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to retrieve mail from mailboxes and pass it to another local mail
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; agent for further processing (often local delivery).&quot; in direct
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; conflict with that statement since it is not fully able to deliver
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; mail to servers that are employing more robust security techniques.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Ones that arre fully RFC approved i might add and have been for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; quite some time.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think this kindles fires around the question what is considered
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;local&quot;, and multiple interpretations are possible, with different
</I>&gt;<i> conclusions/requirements/assumptions:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - if &quot;local&quot; is interpreted as &quot;localhost&quot; (the default SMTP host
</I>&gt;<i> setting), then you could assume that 127.0.0.1 and/or ::1 are
</I>&gt;<i> configured to accept mail for relay without authentication,
</I>&gt;<i> SSL/TLS/STARTTLS.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - if &quot;local&quot; is interpreted as &quot;a computer in the site-wide network&quot;,
</I>&gt;<i> then indeed TLS capability may become a requirement.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Where I become confused, and that is not all that hard to do, is why
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Fetchmail can apparently use TLS to fetch mail; but, it cannot use
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the same mechanism to deliver mail. I don't understand why.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The answer is simple, because nobody has published the code as of yet,
</I>&gt;<i> and I personally can say that I haven't written it either.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> STARTTLS is protocol-specific, so it's not just &quot;use a different
</I>&gt;<i> function to connect&quot; - the latter, however, might give us at least
</I>&gt;<i> SSL-wrapped SMTP (typically port 465), but it, too, needs code to be
</I>&gt;<i> written so that users can configure it, and code that determines if we
</I>&gt;<i> want SSL/TLS-wrapped behaviour or not.  I'd say this goes into
</I>&gt;<i> fetchmail 7.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I have also
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; been told, although I have never personally verified the fact, that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; other programs similar to Fetchmail do offer this capability. Even
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; small utility programs like &quot;Denyhosts&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &lt;<A HREF="http://denyhosts.sourceforge.net/">http://denyhosts.sourceforge.net/</A>&gt;  which I run on my machine fully
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; supports SMTP Authentication and TLS.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Certainly there are packages to support SMTP AUTH and SMTP with
</I>&gt;<i> STARTTLS or SSL/TLS-wrapped connections.  msmtp is an open-source
</I>&gt;<i> package that you could plug into fetchmail through the &quot;mda&quot; option,
</I>&gt;<i> as I have written earlier in this message

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This suggestion adds another layer of complexity which requires
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; further knowledge to correctly setup and the obvious time and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; energy required to do so and maintain said software and its
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; dependency's. I am
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Indeed - however, security sometimes requires sacrificing...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; personally a life time member of the &quot;KISS&quot; principal. Your
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; suggestion, while workable, runs counter to that philosophy. I have
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; all ready stated in another post how I worked around Fetchmail's
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; limitation. I
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> ...the power that combining Unix tools usually provides.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Running tunnels that are created by separate commands often poses
</I>&gt;<i> problems as to figuring out if some software, for instance, fetchmail
</I>&gt;<i> is using the right tunnel, or if through some hicc-up something else
</I>&gt;<i> has claimed the provisioned port - with a non-function in best and
</I>&gt;<i> stolen passwords/mail in the worst case.
</I>
Thanks for your quick reply. I do concur with most of what you have
stated. One area in which I do not totally agree is the
&quot;SSL/TLS-wrapped&quot; proposal. That protocol is deprecated. It usually
required port 465 I believe (I forget right now). Even Postfix does not
by default support that protocol; although, it obviously can be made to
use it. I believe that the only real user of that protocol was MS
Outlook &lt;=2002. All modern MUAs support TLS on port 587 which is also
supported by RFCs. What I am trying to say is that I would certainly
not waste anytime on an obsolete/deprecated protocol, especially one
not supported by current RFCs. I would first work on making Fetchmail
fully TLS (STARTTLS) compliant {Fetchmail 7} before working or wasting
time on a dead protocol.

By the way, I consider &quot;local&quot; as any computer on my site-wide network.
Personally, I think that most users would agree with this
interpretation. Then again, I have been known to be wrong on a few
occasions.
