<PRE>&gt;<i> &gt;   The problem is not with trusting a server's certificate
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   (vs the root certificate which signed it) as such, but with
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   authenticating a certificate -- any certificate -- before
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   trusting it ...
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   There is a lot more authentication work involved, with
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   attendant opportunities for mistakes and/or use of insecure
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   shortcuts, when trusting server certificates than when
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   trusting only root certificates.
</I>
&gt;<i> More fundamentally, you need to have ways to make sure that any
</I>&gt;<i> certificate that you use for authentication purposes is really
</I>&gt;<i> the one it pretends to be ...
</I>
That's what I meant by &quot;authenticating _a certificate_ before
trusting it&quot;, but I can see where that wording might leave room
for confusion since there are at least three different (although
interrelated) authentication processes:

1.  What I called &quot;authenticating the certificate&quot;:  making sure
    that the certificate is really the one it claims to be.  SSL
    does this automatically and transparently, _if_ the certificate
    in question is signed by an already-trusted certificate.
    Ultimately, however, there has to be at least one certificate
    which the SSL administrator has defined as trusted in its own
    right, without resort to signatures.  The process by which that
    trust is established can't be fully automated.

2.  Using the certificate to authenticate the server to which it
    was issued.  SSL does this automatically and transparently,
    based on its store of certificates &quot;trusted in their own right&quot;
    from step 1.

3.  Sending the user's credentials to the server, so that the server
    can authenticate the user.  Fetchmail does this automatically,
    having retrieved the credentials from the fetchmailrc file, but
    only after SSL reports successful completion of step 2.

Step 1 is critical because, if done insecurely, it can result in
the step 3 credentials being revealed to an untrusted party.

&gt;<i> And that's typically a much harder problem than it looks ...
</I>
Indeed.
