Hi Ali,

True enough about \r, and thanks for this valuable suggestion. Erasing the  
last three characters is probably also doable with backspaces, but I don't  
know that for sure. Backspaces and overprint are sometimes used to emulate  
bold printing. I lack the time to research the portability of this,  
there's too much more important stuff on the todo lists.

However I also have the fetchmail code in mind, and I've recently cleaned  
up logging a bit (not completely, there's still a bit of ad-hoc code, but  
at least it's easily identified by the want_progress() macro now) for more  
consistency and less screen clutter (these are two separate achievements  
actually).
We'd have to make major modifications to logging again, particularly to  
either save the beginning of such a whole line and reprint it; or we would  
have to fix the progress reporting to re-generate a whole line all the  
time. Either is nontrivial (i. e. not a central place where you make one  
change, but scattered through the code), and I'm not eager to do that.

I would review patches though -- actual &quot;reset 7 characters&quot; would be more  
useful. So, bottom line: something that

The problem with any such changes to fetchmail is that modules such as  
report.c are lightly documented and often used in arcane undocumented  
ways, interspersed with ad-hoc code all over the place, and sometimes code  
was not moved into a function, but copied and pasted. I attribute this to  
the bazaar-style coding that was en vogue when Eric S. Raymond hacked  
fetchmail and wrote his Cathedral and Bazaar essay (it would be sensible  
to follow up why a bazaar gives you a lump of features, but not a  
consistent piece in one cast).

It often made the code harder to maintain, and before such features can be  
implemented, you need to read major parts of the code to see where else  
you'll find something that influences your current task, and that's also  
why fetchmail progresses rather slowly WRT bugfixing and particularly  
feature additions.
