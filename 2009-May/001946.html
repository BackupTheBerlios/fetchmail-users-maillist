Hash: SHA1

Greetings,

I have uploaded a fetchmail 6.3.10 beta version - &quot;beta&quot; means that some
of the bug fixes have been nontrivial, and testing is required. See the
log below for bugs supposed to be fixed.

Find the tarball at the usual download location:

Happy fetching
Matthias

Changes in fetchmail 6.3.10-beta1 since 6.3.9:

# ADVANCE WARNING OF FEATURES TO BE REMOVED OR CHANGED IN FUTURE VERSIONS
* The maintainer may migrate fetchmail to C++ with STL or C#, and impose further
  requirements (dependencies), such as Boost or other class libraries.
* The softbounce option default will change to &quot;false&quot; in the next release.

fetchmail 6.3.10 (not yet released, beta1 on 2009-05-25):

# INCOMPATIBLE BUGFIXES AND CHANGES
* Fetchmail no longer drops permanently undelivered messages by default, to
  match historic documentation.  It does this by adding a new &quot;softbounce&quot;
  option, see below.
  Fixes Debian Bug#471283, demotes Debian Bug#494418 to wishlist.
* There is a new &quot;softbounce&quot; global option that prevents the deletion of
  messages that have not been forwarded. It defaults to &quot;true&quot; for fetchmail
  6.3.X in order to match historic documentation. This may change its default
  in the next major release.

# BUGFIXES
* Fix misuse of canonical autoconf target as _TARGET when it should have been
  _HOST. Report and patch courtesy of Diego E. &quot;Flameeyes&quot; Petten&#242;.
  Details: <A HREF="http://blog.flameeyes.eu/2009/01/01/the-canonical-target">http://blog.flameeyes.eu/2009/01/01/the-canonical-target</A>
* Do not lose PS_MAXFETCH (13) exit status when hitting maxpoll. Reported by
  Michelle Konzack, Debian Bug#508667.
* Do not overlap source and destination fields in snprintf() in interface.c.
  Courtesy of Nico Golde, Debian.
* When a pre- or post-connect command fails, now report the exit status or
  termination signal properly through sys/wait.h macros.
* When acquiring a body, understand NIL (&quot;no such data item&quot;), as returned by
  some MS Exchange versions. Fixes BerliOS Bug #11980 by KB Sriram.
* Make progress tickers (-v/--showdots) consistent, and update documentation 
  accordingly (&quot;.&quot; for each 1024 octets read, &quot;#&quot; for a header written, and &quot;*&quot; 
  for each body line written.)
  The conditions under which these had been printed were inconsistent,
  illogical, and documentation hadn't matched real behaviour for long.
* For NTLM authentication, use dynamically allocated buffers.
  Fixes Debian Bug#449179, reported by Stepan Golosunov.
* Non-delivery notice (&quot;bounce mail&quot;) now mentions the original reason again,
  before the address list. This fixes a regression introduced in 6.3.0.
* Several compiler warnings were fixed.
* The minimum recommended SMTP (RFC-5321) timeouts are enforced to leave
  sufficient time for the listener to respond. Some synchronous listeners,
  particularly when used with spam filtering and other policy enforcement
  services, take extended amounts of time to process messages after the sender,
  recipient, or data block and EOM line. This can cause fetchmail to not wait
  long enough for the &quot;250 Ok&quot; and make fetchmail believe the message wasn't
  properly delivered when in fact it was; fetchmail would then retry the
  download next time and never make progress.
  Fixes Berlios Bug #10972, reported by Viktor Binzberger.
* The ESMTP/LMTP client will now apply an application-specific timeout while
  waiting for the EHLO/LHLO response, rather than wait for the server or TCP
  connection timeout.
* Treat 530 errors as temporary, so as not to delete messages on configuration
  errors. Partially taken from Petr Cerny's patch in Novell Bugzilla #246829.
  The 501 part of said patch was not added, as the maintainer is not convinced
  501 is a temporary condition, and softbounce takes care of this anyways.

# CHANGES
* Make the comparison of the SSL fingerprints case insensitive, to
  ease its use. Suggested by Daniel Richard G.

# CHANGES TO CONTRIB
* Fix bashism in contrib/fetchsetup. Fixes Debian Bug#530081.

# DOCUMENTATION
* Some parts of the the manual page were revised for clarity, accuracy, and
  updated recommendations (particularly SSL/TLS) and formatting conventions from
  man-pages(7).
* The README and README.SSL documents were updated.
* A document, README.SSL-SERVER, was added to describe server-side requirements
  for proper SSL and/or TLS service offerings. These are not specific to
  fetchmail.

# TRANSLATION UPDATES AND ADDITIONS (ordered by language name):
* [en_GB] English/British
* [de]    German
* [it]    Italian (Vincenzo Campanella)
* [es]    Spanish/Castilian (Francisco Molinero)
