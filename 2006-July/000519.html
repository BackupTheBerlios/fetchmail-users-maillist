<PRE>Greetings!

Has anyone ever seen warning messages of his fetchmail running in daemon
mode that were like:

  Fetchmail saw more than 20 timouts while attempting to get mail from
  <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/fetchmail-users">foo at bar.</A>  This could mean that your mailserver is stuck, or that your
  SMTP listener is wedged, or that your mailbox file on the server has
  been corrupted by a server error.  You can run `fetchmail -v -v' to
  diagnose the problem. Fetchmail won't poll this mailbox again until
  you restart it.

If you've seen these, please report the fetchmail version (type this to
print it, the first line suffices: fetchmail -V | head) and your
operating system and version (type &quot;uname -a&quot; without quote marks to get
this).

This message is supposed to be mailed to a user since 4.6.7, but the
code I've looked at makes it rather unlikely (not to say impossible) to
ever be mailed on operating systems that I'm used to. Before removing
the relevant code for the 6.3.5 update, I'd like to know if someone is
getting these messages.

Thanks!

Kind regards,

--
