&gt;<i>If your inbound server writes X-Original-To: headers, why is a script
</I>needed?

&gt;<i>--
</I>&gt;<i>Matthias Andree
</I>
Hi Matthias,

X-Original-To isn't always there. If I get a mail directed at a mailing list
or sent as a bcc then it isn't always obvious what the sender was.

I'm using fetchmail to receive the mail and drop it to a user on my server.
When
my Postfix gets that mail it can add an X-Original-To but this will be the
name of
the account specified in the &quot;here&quot; clause in fetchmail conf. This is not of
much
use so I don't do that. I did do this originally but soon realised there was
little point.

When the message hits procmail, I run a little script and this extracts a
likely
original destination address, irrespective if it was sent Bcc or via a list,
by
extracting the &quot;Received:&quot; header containing a &quot;for&quot; nearest the mail's
origin.
Procmail then delivers the mail into a user folder based on the address that
was
extracted: if the mail was destined for &quot;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/fetchmail-users">address at domain.com</A>&quot; it hits a
folder called
domain.com/address. This is great as it sorts all my incoming mail from
various
services I subscribe to (I subscribe with a unique address to each one so I
can
track where my address is leaked from as I get spam).

I was originally trying to use Fetchmail's multidrop mode to do what I
wanted but
I didn't fully understand the anatomy of an email so I read the RFC and
re-thought
what I was doing. I don't know if I am doing this the best way, but what
I've got
works for me - it's just a prototype but it seems to be ok.

Thanks for your interest,
John
