GMX are counting connection attempts per unit of time, without stating
clearly how much is too much. Every 5 minutes works.

web.de limit poll intervals for non-paying users for 15 minutes and 1
minute for paying users (but given their abysmal performance and contact
ways, I'd rather not subscribe to their premium service).

&gt;<i> &gt;Trying short poll intervals with &quot;keep&quot; doesn't work too well either.

</I>&gt;<i> What could possibly go wrong?
</I>
The traffic ramps up if considerably you download the possibly long UID
list every 30 seconds, and ISTR that the UID comparison code is still
O(n^2).

&gt;<i> Of course - but they require a specific server setup. I suppose most  
</I>&gt;<i> if not all ISPs would rather take care that their mail servers can  
</I>&gt;<i> handle short polling intervals of their customers, than offer an

</I>&gt;<i> Complexity is more expensive than faster hardware.
</I>
Probably.

&gt;<i> Also, this would only be reasonably easy to configure if the client  
</I>&gt;<i> machine had a fixed IP address.
</I>
If it doesn't, ODMR might be an alternative, but again that boils down
to polling intervals...

&gt;<i> Of course, the ideal solution technically would be a mail server that  
</I>&gt;<i> delivers mail directly via SMTP as long as this works, and  
</I>&gt;<i> immediately switches to POP when the recipient's computer isn't  
</I>&gt;<i> connected to the network anymore.
</I>
That requires a notion of &quot;being logged in&quot; with authentication that
neither SMTP nor POP3 offer. IMAP offers this as long as the server
knows the IDLE extension, it's fetchmail's end that falls a bit short
here.
