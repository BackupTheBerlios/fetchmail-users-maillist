I know just enough C to be dangerous. And what I did know and used 20+ 
years ago has faded into the inner reaches of a 78 year old retired tv 
chief engineers rust wet ram.

And I'm stuck running on an older ubuntu LTS because its the only one we 
have built an RTAI kernel for, and which linuxcnc needs.  And the 10.04.4 
LTS repo only has 6.3.9rc2.

I was trying to build 6.3.24 with ssl support, but even if I give the 
configure script the exact path to the binary, it claims its not found.

I have, since I posted, googled and pulled the srcs for 6.3.26, 
openssl-1.0.1e (current install is 9.8k), and procmail-3.22 (current as it 
appears) but I need to know what exactly it is looking for when it reports 
it cannot find OpenSSL, which if course is not the case correct name of the 
package itself.

With this command line:
./configure --prefix=/usr --with-ssl=/usr/bin/openssl
exits eventually:
configure: error: SSL support enabled, but OpenSSL not found

And that is where the actual openssl binary is located.

Any help as I try to update to the newer openssl-1.01e and finally 
fetchmail would be appreciated very much.

I will  attempt to follow the instructions from
<A HREF="http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/view/svn/postlfs/openssl.html">http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/view/svn/postlfs/openssl.html</A>
to update my openssl first.  They also seem to have an uptodate sequence 
for fetchmail on that site also.  So perhaps I won't have to bother you 
again.

Thank you

Cheers, Gene
