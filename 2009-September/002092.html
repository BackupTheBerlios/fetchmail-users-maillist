</I>&gt;<i> Dear Joost,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'll take the liberty of copying my response to the list for the benefit

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks for trying that out and sharing your findings; I'll note this down
</I>&gt;<i> as a bug and see if I have time to fix it before the 6.3.12 release.
</I>
I don't mind, a mailing list is, in my opinion, meant for everyone who reads 
it. If someone finds a problem and/or a solution, it can only benefit others as 
well.

Please note, that I tested this with 6.3.8.
I have only this morning upgraded to 6.3.11.
I will test this again this week and let you know. (It might have been fixed in 
the meantime)

&gt;<i> &gt; I actually can follow most items in the different manpages.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Something that is missing is a bit more description on how to use
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; multi-drop mailboxes as creating different mailboxes with ISPs can be a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; costly business as I want to give different companies different emails
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to send mail to me with.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; That way I know who is leaking my email address to spammers and I can
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; take action accordingly.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not sure I understand your need yet. Could you reword this as a (set
</I>&gt;<i> of) question(s) that you need answered by me?
</I>
My requirement for using multi-drop mailboxes is so that when a company (lets 
assume it's called &quot;example&quot;) asks me for an email address so they can contact 
me for legitimate reasons. I will then give them &quot;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/fetchmail-users">example at domain.com</A>&quot; as email 
address.
I then set up the virtual-table to redirect this to who-ever wants to see 
these emails. (sieve doesn't work for shared mail-boxes, different story)
If I then get spam sent to this address, I can then complain directly to them.

I know this is a bit of a round-a-bout way, but it works. And as my ISP 
charges for additional mailboxes, I decided to use a multi-drop one. Also as I 
don't always want to configure one with my ISP in advance.

The bit for you (assuming you maintain the man-page, and your comment earlier 
does indicate that) is that I can see several examples for the options for a 
'normal' mailbox, but the examples for multi-drop are quite basic.

Something that could help would be how the different options work together in 
the fetchmailrc file and what each options effect has.

&gt;<i> &gt; I did manage to get it working, by altering the virtual table. For some
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; reason, postfix is trying to match every domain that it should accept
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; mail for to the virtual table. Eg. not just what is configured as
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; virtual_host.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What exactly does it do wrong in your perception?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Note there is no virtual_host parameter in Postfix, if this is from
</I>&gt;<i> main.cf, it's in error.
</I>
First off, my mail server is now working as I want it to, even though I still 
think it's not the way it should. (all comments are to be taken as &quot;IMO&quot;)
I double-checked the main.cf file.
I set: 
virtual_alias_domains = virtual.domain.org
virtual_alias_maps = ldap:/etc/postfix/ldap-virtual.cf

I also have:
mydestination = domain.org, localhost

While testing a few settings with fetchmail, including the option you 
mentioned, I noticed that it also tries to match &quot;@domain.org&quot; against the 
virtual_alias_map (different ldap search base, so easy to spot)

&lt;snipped&gt;

&gt;<i> Remember there is &quot;soft_bounce=yes&quot; for testing, I'd advise setting it
</I>&gt;<i> before stuffing domains into the virtual_*_* parameters and/or before
</I>&gt;<i> removing domains from mydestination until convinced that everything works
</I>&gt;<i> properly.
</I>
I disable the fetchmail email collection while testing and then use fetchmail 
only against the catch-all mailbox. This isn't in use yet so emails sent there 
are only from me. (use gmail to fill that box)
Then if, after testing, it still doesn't work, I undo the changes before 
reenabling fetchmail.
My ISP sometimes blocks incoming port 25, so can't expose my mail server to 
collect directly.

&gt;<i> HTH
</I>
Your (and others) comments are always helpfull and much appreciated.

I am planning on duplicating my mail server on a virtual machine on my desktop 
for further testing with this, rather then risking the real mail-server.

Thanks,

Joost
