<PRE>Hi Rob - thanks for your patience. I also appreciate that of the list
moderator(s).

&gt;<i> Then I'd definitely recommend an all-in-one package.
</I>
I haven't been able to find one yet that describes itself as incorporating
the ability to pop my mail from my ISP, in a manner similar to how Fetchmail
describes itself. Am I missing something? Is there a package you would
recommend by name?

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 1) What SMTP software you want to use (Sendmail, Postfix, Exim, or
</I>others)
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> So, here's a good example. Do I need to use SMTP software in the first
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> place?
</I>
&gt;<i> Yes.  That is what fetchmail will hand the mail over to, that's how
</I>&gt;<i> you will send outbound email.
</I>
Er, okay. This confuses me. I thought fetchmail would, uh, fetch my mail
from my ISP and hand it off to whatever mail server software I ran, which
would somehow &quot;pop-to-smtp&quot; it and take care of storing it in an appropriate
manner. I figured that &quot;sending&quot; mail would be handled by the mail server
software (a term I'm using interchangeably with &quot;MTA&quot;, probably in error).
How does Fetchmail send mail - unless I can interpret that to mean that
Fetchmail would hand mail over to an MTA, which would send it if the user
was not local to the server the MTA is running on. Is that generally
correct, or am I missing something?

&gt;&gt;<i> It is my
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> understanding that Fetchmail will take care of the pop angle; do I need
</I>an
&gt;&gt;<i> SMTP server with which Fetchmail will interact, in order to &quot;store&quot; the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> mail, and as well in order to take care of &quot;storing&quot; outbound SMTP mail
</I>from
&gt;&gt;<i> the mail clients (and, for that matter, sending the outbound SMTP mail to
</I>my
&gt;&gt;<i> ISP)?
</I>
&gt;<i> Note that SMTP is a message *transfer* protocol.  It doesn't store
</I>&gt;<i> anything, it just enables you to send (and receive) email.
</I>
Okay, but mail has to be stored somewhere, right, by something? While I
generally understand that mail could be stored in a database, LDAP
directory, etc, it is my understanding that a common way of mail being
stored is actually in files in directories (is this a &quot;maildir&quot;
configuration?) Something has to put the mail in the right directories, so
that when mail client software interacts with mail server software the
client knows which directories and files to refer to for that user's mail.

If this is starting to sound like I really need to go away and read a decent
book/website that will run me through some basic Internet e-mail concepts,
architectures, and terminology, by the way, I'm happy to be pointed off to
something appropriate.

Maybe it might help (me, anyway) if I hypothesize two different scenarios:
(A), where I want to pop my mail from my ISP and store it on my server, and
I will use a mail client on that same server to read and respond to the
mail; and (B) where I will use a mail client on a different workstation to
read and respond to mail stored on the server.

Under scenario (A), I would perhaps need three different software packages:
something like Fetchmail which will pop my mail for me, and hand it off to a
mail server of some sort (postfix, courier, etc). Lastly, a mail client
(mutt, etc), which will interact with the mail server to allow me to read
and respond to messages. Generally correct so far?

Under scenario (B), I need the same three types of software as in (A), plus
something that will allow me to connect from my client workstation to the
mail server (perhaps something like courier-imap). Generally correct so far?
If so, then I'm confused by this:


&gt;&gt;<i> 2) The SMTP server takes care of properly storing the mail, and of
</I>sending
&gt;&gt;<i> SMTP mail back to my ISP; and
</I>
&gt;<i> No - the IMAP software stores the email.  The SMTP software simply
</I>&gt;<i> hands incoming email to it.
</I>
Okay, then perhaps I really have a terminology problem here. As above, I've
been using &quot;mail server&quot; as synonymous with &quot;SMTP server&quot; or &quot;MTA&quot;. It
sounds like I need to think of the IMAP software (courier-imap, etc) as the
&quot;mail server&quot;. Am I more correct now?  If so, thinking back to my scenario
(A) from above (mail client local to the server), what software would take
care of storing the e-mail? Would I still need to run IMAP software (or POP3
software, or some other kind of software) because my mail client will not,
on purpose, interface directly with the SMTP software? I really hope I'm
starting to get warmer now on this.


&gt;&gt;<i> If that's generally correct, then I think I'll take advantage of your
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> helpfulness and veer perhaps wildly off-topic to ask about calendaring,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> contacts, and all the other related stuff one normally associates with an
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Outlook/Exchange environment. Does any of the software we're discussing
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> handle these as well, or in my scenario would I still have a PST local to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> each client workstation that would store these items, leaving only the
</I>mail
&gt;&gt;<i> on the central server?
</I>
&gt;<i> Take a look at Zimbra, OpenGroupware and others.  Those are the ones
</I>&gt;<i> that do calendaring and contacts (well, you can do it yourself with
</I>&gt;<i> other software, but it's a lot more work).
</I>
I don't need any kind of shared calendaring at all; independent calendars
for each user are just fine. Right now, we're using full Outlook clients but
not in an Exchange environment. Given the way I want to re-engineer our
e-mail (still using Outlook clients), I want to make sure I'm able to retain
the other associated functionality the Outlook clients provide, such as
calendar, contacts, notes, etc. This probably veers wildly off-topic for the
list, but if I can somehow keep that extra, non-email functionality (perhaps
Outlook will be smart enough to keep a small PST local for it?) then I'm a
happy camper.


&gt;&gt;<i> I'm also interested in the capability to access e-mail via a web
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> interface,
</I>
&gt;<i> The 2 mail choices, if your package doesn't include it, are
</I>&gt;<i> SquirrelMail and Horde.  SquirrelMail is much simpler and more basic,
</I>&gt;<i> if you just want a webmail interface then I'd recommend it.
</I>
Yes, I think that's the impression I'm getting from general web searching
and browsing. It's a bit later on my to-do list, though, after I solve the
more pressing issues.

&gt;<i> I'll also suggest something bordering on the heritical - Google Apps
</I>&gt;<i> ;)  You get all the features you've discussed, but don't have to
</I>&gt;<i> invest the time and effort into learning how to do it if you don't
</I>&gt;<i> want to.  Their standard edition is free and is for up to 50 users.
</I>
That has certain attractions. I'd prefer to puzzle it out more before
resigning myself to going down that road, though. While time and effort
aren't limitless resources, it's fun learning new stuff.

My thanks again for your patience and help.
