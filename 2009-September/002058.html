Even if none of them include fetchmail, adding fetchmail is trivial.
Packages I'm aware of (I've not used any of them) include Zimbra and
OpenGroupware.

&gt;<i> Er, okay. This confuses me. I thought fetchmail would, uh, fetch my mail

</I>&gt;<i> software (a term I'm using interchangeably with &quot;MTA&quot;, probably in error).
</I>&gt;<i> How does Fetchmail send mail - unless I can interpret that to mean that
</I>&gt;<i> Fetchmail would hand mail over to an MTA, which would send it if the user

</I>&gt;<i> correct, or am I missing something?
</I>
The process for inbound email, in general is:

Sender -&gt; Their ISP's SMTP -&gt; Your ISP's SMTP -&gt; Your ISP's POP/IMAP

When you add fetchmail this adds the following to the end of that:

-&gt; fetchmail -&gt; Your SMTP -&gt; Your POP/IMAP

Fetchmail simply collects the email from a remote POP/IMAP host and
then hands it over to another SMTP server (MTA).

&gt;<i> Okay, but mail has to be stored somewhere, right, by something?
</I>
By your POP/IMAP server.

&gt;<i> If this is starting to sound like I really need to go away and read a decent
</I>&gt;<i> book/website that will run me through some basic Internet e-mail concepts,
</I>&gt;<i> architectures, and terminology, by the way, I'm happy to be pointed off to
</I>&gt;<i> something appropriate.
</I>
Unfortunately I don't know of any - I've been doing this for a long time now ;)

&gt;<i> Maybe it might help (me, anyway) if I hypothesize two different scenarios:
</I>&gt;<i> (A), where I want to pop my mail from my ISP and store it on my server, and
</I>&gt;<i> I will use a mail client on that same server to read and respond to the
</I>&gt;<i> mail; and (B) where I will use a mail client on a different workstation to
</I>&gt;<i> read and respond to mail stored on the server.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Under scenario (A), I would perhaps need three different software packages:
</I>&gt;<i> something like Fetchmail which will pop my mail for me, and hand it off to a
</I>&gt;<i> mail server of some sort (postfix, courier, etc). Lastly, a mail client
</I>&gt;<i> (mutt, etc), which will interact with the mail server to allow me to read
</I>&gt;<i> and respond to messages. Generally correct so far?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Under scenario (B), I need the same three types of software as in (A), plus
</I>&gt;<i> something that will allow me to connect from my client workstation to the
</I>&gt;<i> mail server (perhaps something like courier-imap). Generally correct so far?
</I>
Both scenarios need the same software.  The only difference is that in
(A) the mail server is on the same host as the mail client.  That's
it, nothing more.  Your MUA (Mail User Agent - the client) is still
required.


&gt;<i> Okay, then perhaps I really have a terminology problem here. As above, I've
</I>&gt;<i> been using &quot;mail server&quot; as synonymous with &quot;SMTP server&quot; or &quot;MTA&quot;. It
</I>&gt;<i> sounds like I need to think of the IMAP software (courier-imap, etc) as the
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;mail server&quot;. Am I more correct now?
</I>
Maybe ;)

A traditional &quot;mail server&quot; is both.  It contains the SMTP software to
receive and send email and POP/IMAP software to allow people to read
it.

&gt;<i>&#160;If so, thinking back to my scenario
</I>&gt;<i> (A) from above (mail client local to the server), what software would take
</I>&gt;<i> care of storing the e-mail? Would I still need to run IMAP software (or POP3
</I>&gt;<i> software, or some other kind of software) because my mail client will not,
</I>&gt;<i> on purpose, interface directly with the SMTP software? I really hope I'm
</I>&gt;<i> starting to get warmer now on this.
</I>
Correct - your mail client (MUA) will talk to the POP/IMAP server to
read email.  It doesn't (and can't) communicate directly with the SMTP
server to read email.

&gt;<i> I don't need any kind of shared calendaring at all; independent calendars
</I>&gt;<i> for each user are just fine. Right now, we're using full Outlook clients but
</I>&gt;<i> not in an Exchange environment. Given the way I want to re-engineer our
</I>&gt;<i> e-mail (still using Outlook clients), I want to make sure I'm able to retain
</I>&gt;<i> the other associated functionality the Outlook clients provide, such as
</I>&gt;<i> calendar, contacts, notes, etc. This probably veers wildly off-topic for the
</I>&gt;<i> list, but if I can somehow keep that extra, non-email functionality (perhaps
</I>&gt;<i> Outlook will be smart enough to keep a small PST local for it?) then I'm a
</I>&gt;<i> happy camper.
</I>
Yes, and that's how I used to do it.
