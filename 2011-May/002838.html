<PRE>Greetings,

this release candidate reverts ineffective changes and polishes
documentation a bit, and should be fit for release.

Please test fetchmail 6.3.20-rc3 on your operating system.
To do that, please:

1. download and unpack the fetchmail tarball (URLs below)
2. cd to to the unpacked directory
3. ./configure and install as usual
4. run fetchmail with these additional options:
   --auth any -vvvd0 --nodetach --nosyslog
5. report success or failure to the list or me personally.

PLEASE HELP: If you can offer access to test servers that I can send a
short test mail to and then log into to retrieve that test message -
particularly Exchange 2007 or Exchange 2010 is desired, but others
besides Cyrus IMAP and Dovecot are also welcome - please let me know.

PLEASE HELP: fetchmail needs translators for the program strings. Some
languages (such as those shown below) are in quite good shape, but
others are lacking a bit.  Translation information can be found at
&lt;<A HREF="http://translationproject.org/domain/fetchmail.html">http://translationproject.org/domain/fetchmail.html</A>&gt;

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

DOWNLOAD this beta software from:
&lt;<A HREF="http://home.pages.de/~mandree/fetchmail/">http://home.pages.de/~mandree/fetchmail/</A>&gt;

The repository can be browsed at and cloned from:
&lt;<A HREF="http://gitorious.org/fetchmail/fetchmail">http://gitorious.org/fetchmail/fetchmail</A>&gt; - the branch is &quot;legacy_63&quot;.

controlled) information is at: &lt;<A HREF="http://git-scm.com/">http://git-scm.com/</A>&gt;

CHANGES since the previous formal release of fetchmail listed below.
Unless otherwise noted, the changes were made by Matthias Andree:

# ADVANCE WARNING OF FEATURES TO BE REMOVED OR CHANGED IN FUTURE VERSIONS
(There are no plans to remove features from a 6.3.X release, but they may be
removed from a 6.4.0 or newer release.)
* The MX and host alias DNS lookups that fetchmail performs in multidrop mode
  are based on assumptions that are rarely met in practice, somewhat defective,
  deprecated and may be removed from a future fetchmail version.
  They have never supported IPv6 (including IPv6-mapped IPv4).
  Non-DNS based alias keywords such as &quot;aka&quot; will remain in fetchmail.
* The monitor and interface options may be removed from a future fetchmail
  version as they are not reasonably portable across operating systems.
* POP2 is obsolete, support will be removed from a future fetchmail version.
* IMAP2 and IMAP4 (not IMAP4r1) are obsolete, support may be removed from a
  future fetchmail version.
* RPOP is obsolete, support will be removed from a future fetchmail release.
* --sslcertck will become a default setting in a future fetchmail version.
* The multidrop To/Cc guessing code along with the fragile duplicate suppressor
  is deprecated and may be removed from a future release.
* The &quot;envelope Received&quot; option may be removed from a future release, because
  the Received header was never meant to be machine-readable, the format varies
  widely, and various other differences in behavior make parsing Received an
  unreliable undertaking. The envelope option as such will remain though, in
  order to support Delivered-To, X-Envelope-To, X-Original-To and similar.
  See also &lt;<A HREF="http://home.pages.de/~mandree/mail/multidrop">http://home.pages.de/~mandree/mail/multidrop</A>&gt;.
* The --enable-fallback (fall back to MDA if MTA unavailable) will be removed
  from a future fetchmail release, because it makes fetchmail's behavior
  inconsistent and confusing.
* The &quot;protocol auto&quot; default inside fetchmail may be removed from a future
  fetchmail release. Explicit configuration of the protocol is recommended.
* Kerberos IV support may be removed from a future fetchmail release.
* Kerberos 5 support may be removed from a future fetchmail release.
* The --principal option may be removed from a future fetchmail release.
* SIGHUP wakeup support may be removed from a future fetchmail release and
  cause fetchmail to terminate - it was broken for many years.
* Support for operating systems that are not sufficiently POSIX compliant may be
  removed or operation on such systems may be suboptimal for future releases.
  This means that fetchmail may only continue to work on C99 and POSIX 2001
  based systems.
* The maintainer may migrate fetchmail to C++ with STL or C#, and impose further
  requirements (dependencies), such as Boost or other class libraries.
* The softbounce option default will change to &quot;false&quot; in the next release.
* The --bsmtp - mode of operation may be removed in a future release.
* Given that OpenSSL is severely underdocumented, and needs license exceptions,
  fetchmail may switch to a different SSL library.
* SSLv2 support will be removed from a future fetchmail release. It has been
  obsolete for more than a decade.

fetchmail-6.3.20 (not yet released, 26005 LoC):

# SECURITY BUG FIXES
* STARTTLS: Fetchmail runs the IMAP STARTTLS or POP3 STLS negotiation with the
  set timeout (default five minutes) now. This was reported missing, with
  observed fetchmail freezes beyond a week, by Thomas Jarosch.
     SSL-wrapped connections were unaffected by this timeout, so users of older
  versions can force ssl-wrapped connections -- if supported by the server --
  with the --ssl command line or ssl rcfile option.

# BUG FIXES
* IMAP: Do not search for UNSEEN messages in ranges. Usually, there are very few
  new messages and most of the range searches result in nothing. Instead, split
  the long response to make the IMAP driver think that there are multiple lines
  of response. (Sunil Shetye)
* Do not print &quot;skipping message&quot; for old messages even in verbose mode. If
  there are too many old messages, the logs just get filled without any real
  activity. (Sunil Shetye) (suggested by Yunfan Jiang)
* Build: fetchmail now always uses its own MD5 implementation rather than trying
  to find a system library with matched header. The library and header variants
  found on systems are too diverse, and the code size saving is not worth any
  more wasted user or programmer time.

# CHANGES
* Call strlen() only once when removing CRLF from a line. (Sunil Shetye)
* fetchmail sets Internet domain sockets to &quot;keepalive&quot; mode now. Note that
  there is no portable way to configure actual timeouts for this mode, and some
  systems only support a system-wide timeout setting. fetchmail does not
  attempt to tune the time spans of keepalive mode.
