<PRE>Hi Matthias,



----- Original Message -----
&gt;&gt;<i>  hi, tried fetchmail after i decide to use mutt
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  and found its very quick than web interface with my gmail
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  but there's a problem(the only one) bored me
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  i use imap protocol to fetch my gmail
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  and i use cmd&#160; fetchmail -v to check by manual
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  each time it will check lots of mail with flag 'Seen', as 
</I>&gt;<i> gmail's huge
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  storage usage, i stored so many mails
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  in it,so each time its a long time to wait fetchmail told me skip thousands
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  of mails like this:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> You can suppress the messages with -s.
</I>
I think the real issue is not related to IMAP at all. What Yunfan Jiang may be trying to say is that when fetchmail -v runs without syslog, there are too many skipping messages without any real protocol level activity. Note that this is true for both IMAP and POP3. This is also true for fetchmail -v -v.

Say, there are 20,000 mails with just one new mail. When a user runs &quot;fetchmail -v --nosyslog&quot; or &quot;fetchmail -v -v&quot;, the user sees some protocol level activity at the start. This could be &quot;SEARCH UNSEEN&quot; for IMAP or &quot;UIDL&quot; for POP3. From that activity, it becomes clear that there is just one new mail.

What follows this activity is a series of &quot;skipping message n&quot; lines from 1 to 19,999. These lines do not make any sense if all the user is trying to do is to look at the protocol level logs for the 20,000th mail. In fact, if the output is to the terminal, these 19,999 lines without any real IMAP/POP3 activity can lead to a slow scrolling. There is also the risk of hitting the timeout at the mailserver since no real activity has occurred on the mailserver end while those 19,999 lines are getting printed.

For IMAP, the logs could look like:

IMAP&gt; A0010 SEARCH UNSEEN
IMAP&lt; * SEARCH 20000
IMAP&lt; A0010 OK SEARCH completed
skipping message <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/fetchmail-users">... at ...</A>:1 (not flushed)
skipping message <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/fetchmail-users">... at ...</A>:2 (not flushed)
skipping message <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/fetchmail-users">... at ...</A>:3 (not flushed)
...
skipping message <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/fetchmail-users">... at ...</A>:19997 (not flushed)
skipping message <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/fetchmail-users">... at ...</A>:19998 (not flushed)
skipping message <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/fetchmail-users">... at ...</A>:19999 (not flushed)
IMAP&gt; A0011 FETCH 20000 RFC822.SIZE

The real solution would be to remove all the &quot;skipping message n (not flushed)&quot; messages if they are not related to any protocol activity as they do not add any real value. The patch attached should do the trick. Please check and evaluate. Note that I have not tested for POP3 with UIDL as yet.
