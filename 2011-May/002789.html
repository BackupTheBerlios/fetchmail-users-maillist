Jonathan,

please don't top-post, but quote only relevant message parts and respond
below.


The behaviour you hope for is a policy question, and should be left to
the user.  I don't plan to add an option now because I'm on the brink of
doing major changes, and adding options is a major hassle, and in this
case one that is likely short-lived.  I could offer an environment
option for 6.3.20 that only marks \Deleted, rather than \Seen.  I will
not change default behaviour in 6.3.X.

Please try the attached patch against 6.3.19.

Incidentally, I have just sent a discussion proposal to the -devel list
where it's part to address that \Seen marking in a future fetchmail
release and do away with it altogether - we need to do that in order to
fetch from READ-ONLY mailboxes anyways. :)

Best regards
Matthias

    Add FETCHMAIL_IMAP_DELETED_REMAINS_UNSEEN env' var.
    
    Requested by Jonathan Buschmann, to suppress read-notifications on
    servers such as MS Exchange or HP OpenMail.
