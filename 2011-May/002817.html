Errr, are you aware of rss2email - <A HREF="http://rss2email.infogami.com/">http://rss2email.infogami.com/</A> ? :)

Other than that, I don't really think that fetchmail would be a very
good base for your tool - it doesn't really *create* e-mail messages, it
merely fetches the pretty much ready-made messages from a server, parses
them and passes them on :)  Well, okay, so it does some processing and
sometimes it modifies the messages, adding a header here and there and
such; however, its basic idea is not exactly that.

You might want to start with any of the open-source RSS readers out
there; there's a *lot* to choose from.  All of them should do *most* of
what you want - keep a database of feeds and posts within the feeds,
fetch and parse the feeds looking for new posts, then... do *something*
with the new posts.  The hardest part in adapting them to your needs
might be actually creating a MIME-formatted e-mail message with the
post's content; however, there are a lot of examples for that out there
on the Internet, too - starting with rss2email :)

Hope that helps!

G'luck,
Peter
