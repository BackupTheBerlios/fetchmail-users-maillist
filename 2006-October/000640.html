Greetings,

I am announcing the release of fetchmail 6.3.5. This new stable version
of fetchmail fixes several minor bugs and revises the FAQ.

The software is available from:
&lt;<A HREF="http://developer.berlios.de/project/showfiles.php?group_id=1824&amp;release_id=11358">http://developer.berlios.de/project/showfiles.php?group_id=1824&amp;release_id=11358</A>&gt;

These are the relevant changes in 6.3.5 since 6.3.4;
unless otherwise noted, changes to this release were made by Matthias Andree:

fetchmail 6.3.5 (released 2006-10-09):

# DEPRECATED FEATURES AND MAJOR INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE ADVANCE WARNINGS
* The MX and host alias DNS lookups that fetchmail performs in multidrop mode
  are obsolete, deprecated and may be removed from a future fetchmail version.
  They have never supported IPv6 (including IPv6-mapped IPv4) anyhow.
  Non-DNS based alias keywords such as &quot;aka&quot; will remain in fetchmail.
* The monitor and interface options may be removed from a future fetchmail
  version as they are not sufficiently portable.
* POP2 is obsolete.
  Support for POP2 may be removed from a future fetchmail version.
* RPOP is obsolete, support may be removed from a future fetchmail release.
* --sslcertck may become a default setting in a future fetchmail version.
* The multidrop To/Cc guessing code along with the fragile duplicate suppressor
  is deprecated and may be removed from a future release.
* The &quot;envelope Received&quot; option may be removed from a future release, because
  the Received header was never meant to be machine-readable, the format varies
  widely, and various other differences in behavior make parsing Received an
  unreliable undertaking. The enveloper option as such will remain though, in
  order to support Delivered-To, X-Envelope-To, X-Original-To and similar.
  See also &lt;<A HREF="http://home.pages.de/~mandree/mail/multidrop">http://home.pages.de/~mandree/mail/multidrop</A>&gt;.
* The --enable-fallback (fall back to MDA if MTA unavailable) may be removed
  from a future fetchmail release.
* The &quot;protocol auto&quot; default inside fetchmail may be removed from a future
  fetchmail release. Explicit configuration of the protocol is recommended.
* Kerberos IV support may be removed from a future fetchmail release.
* SIGHUP wakeup may be removed from a future fetchmail release and cause it
  to terminate.
* Support for operating systems that are not sufficiently POSIX compliant may be
  removed or operation on such systems may be suboptimal for future releases.

# KNOWN BUGS AND WORKAROUNDS:
  (this section floats upwards through the NEWS to be on top of the list)
* fetchmail does not handle messages without Message-ID header well
  (See sourceforge.net bug #780933)
* Sun Workshop 6 (SPARC) is known to miscompile the lexer in 64-bit mode.
  Either compile 32-bit code or use GCC to compile 64-bit fetchmail.
  Note that fetchmail doesn't take advantage of 64-bit code anyways,
  so compiling 32-bit SPARC code should be fine.
* fetchmail expects Received: headers in a particular format when parsing
  envelopes.
* fetchmail does not track pending deletes over crashes
* the command line interface is a bit narrow-minded sometimes, for instance,
  fetchmail -s doesn't work with a running daemon
* some of the logging output is not very helpful
* some of the documentation is still not up to date

# BUG FIXES:
* For protocols such as IMAP that are not delimited by &quot;.&quot; lines, truncate the
  input buffer when the message has been completely read, to avoid taking
  trailing garbage into the message if the terminal CRLF is missing. Fixes
  Debian Bug#312415. (Patch suggested by Mike Jones, Manchester Univ.).
* When using NTLM authentication, use regular IMAP response code handler after
  completing NTLM handshake, for robustness and consistency.
  (Taken from the NetBSD portable packages collection, patch-ac.)
* Support Kerberos installations where krb5.h and perhaps roken.h are in
  .../include/krb5.  Taken from NetBSD portable packages collection patch-ae.
* On NetBSD, link against -lroken -lcom_err if --with-kerberos is enabled.
* Drop #include &lt;com_err.h&gt; from Kerberos 5 header file, fixes compile error on
  SUSE Linux 10.0.
* Fix des_pcbc_encrypt compile warnings in kerberos.c line 246.
* If krb5-config provides gssapi library information, use that rather than
  guessing.
* Improve --with-gssapi auto detection for /usr-based GSSAPI installs.
* Fix --with-gssapi builds for NetBSD 3.0.
* Improve KAME/getnameinfo.c portability to Linux libc5 systems.
  Based on a patch by Dan Fandrich.
* Provide INET6 to KAME/getnameinfo.c (only useful on IPv6-enabled systems that
  lack getnameinfo, and there only visible in some Received: headers).
  Found by Dan Fandrich.
* POP3: some UID flags may not be set properly on UIDL lists. (Sunil Shetye)
* Make IMAP4 IDLE work on servers that do not update RECENT counts.
  Reported by Lars Tewes.
* IMAP4 patch by Sunil Shetye:
  - do not depend on server updating RECENT counts at all
  - also enter IDLE loop when messages are present on the server.
* Fix --flush description in the manual page, fetchmail does not mark messages
  seen unless it has successfully delivered them. Suggested by Frederic Marchal.
* Fetchmail no longer attempts to stat the &quot;-&quot; file in daemon mode -- this is a
  special name to read the RC file from stdin, and cannot always be re-read
  anyways. BerliOS bug #7858.
* When looking up ports for a service, the lookup succeeds and the returned
  address family isn't IPv4 or IPv6, properly free the allocated memory from the
  service lookup. Found by Uli Zappe.
* When looking up ports for a service, only look up TCP ports.
* Avoid compiling empty files, to avoid diagnostics from strict compilers.
* If the lockfile ends before the process ID, treat it as stale and unlink it.
  Reported by Justin Pryzby, Debian Bug #376603.
* SIGHUP wake-up behavior was broken since 5.9.13's Cygwin changes, in that for
  non-root users, SIGHUP would abort the first poll and subsequently interfere
  with new polls, and SIGHUP would be ignored for root users. SIGHUP now matches
  documented behavior. SIGUSR1 has always been a wakeup signal for both root
  (undocumented) and non-root users. See also the deprecation warning above.
* Track getaddrinfo() results to properly free them after timeouts and make sure
  that getaddrinfo() isn't interrupted by a timeout (which breaks on MacOS X),
  reported by Uli Zappe.  This should fix Debian Bug#294547 and Bug#377135.
* --logfile is now handled more carefully, errors opening the logfile are
  now reported to the TTY where fetchmail was started from.
* fetchmail now complains and aborts when it cannot properly daemonize itself.
* fix compilation on systems that don't know struct addrinfo (Solaris 2.6).
* ignore SIGPIPE signals and rely on functions to return EPIPE instead. This is
  necessary because the former longjmp() from the signal handler is unsafe and
  makes the whole fetchmail behavior undefined after the event.
* Avoid crash in env.c/host_fqdn if we cannot canonicalize our own hostname.
  Reported by Alexander Holler.
* SSL fix by Miloslav Trmac (Red Hat): free the SSL contexts after the
  connection, to avoid from growing SSL certpaths without bounds, avoid using
  SSL contexts for unrelated connections, and to fix Red Hat Bug #206346.

# CHANGES:
* Rename all fetchmail-internal lock_* functions to fm_lock_*. Obsoletes
  NetBSD portable packages collection patch-ah, patch-ai and patch-aj.
* Configure prints a warning (but proceeds) if Kerberos IV support is enabled.
* In verbose mode, log every IP fetchmail tries to connect to, to avoid
  misleading the user. Suppress EAFNOSUPPORT errors from socket() call, too.
  Fixes Debian Bug #361825, reported by Daniel Baur.
* In idle mode, fetchmail complains about the fetchall option.
* When a connection fails, log not only the IP address, but also host and
  service name and the port number. Log the latter when trying to connect in
  verbose mode, too.
* Keep syslog output at one line per message (this works if no errors occur).
* Fetchmail in verbose mode now logs if it opportunistically upgrades a POP3
  or IMAP connection to TLS security with STLS/STARTTLS.
* fetchmail now supports <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/fetchmail-users">foo at example.org</A>=bar user mappings for multidrop boxes.
* switch setjmp/longjmp to sigsetjmp/siglongjmp
* IMAP now supports the EXTERNAL authentication method, courtesy of
  G&#246;tz 'nimrill' Babin-Ebell, BerliOS patch #1095 with minor changes.
* The sslproto keywords are now case insensitive, courtesy of
  G&#246;tz 'nimrill' Babin-Ebell, BerliOS patch #1095.
* When going to sleep, log for how long.  Suggested by Claudia Ludwig.
* When the server name cannot be canonicalized, log the gai_strerror value.

# TRANSLATION UPDATES:
* Catalan/ca (Ernest Adrogu&#233; Calveras), Japanese/ja (Takeshi Hamasaki) - also
  made gettext 0.15 ready, Polish/pl (Jakub Bogusz), Russian/ru (Pavel
  Maryanov), Spanish/es (H&#233;ctor Garc&#237;a &#193;lvarez), Vietnamese/vi (Clytie Siddall)

# CONTRIBUTED SCRIPTS:
* PopDel.py was revised by Joshua Crawford to display the From: address and
  list every email, even if it has no Subject: header; and not delete the wrong
  message in the presence of mail without Subject: headers.

Regards,
