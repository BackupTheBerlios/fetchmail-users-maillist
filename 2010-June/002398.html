<PRE>Greetings-

I'm having an intermittent issue with establishing an SSL connection to
the pop server for Yahoo's Plus Mail.  First, the introductions:

System- Debian/Squeeze running fetchmail v6.3.17-1 and openssl v0.9.8o-1

The error is simply a common name mismatch.  The fetchmailrc line is as
follows:

    poll plus.pop.mail.yahoo.com with proto POP3 port 995
            user '<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/fetchmail-users">user at yahoo.com</A>' there with password 'password' is 'user' here options keep ssl sslcertck sslcertpath /etc/ssl/certs/

It is setup as a cron job that runs every hour. The crontab entry is as
follows:

    53 * * * * fetchmail -s || [ $? -eq 1 ]


The error I get from cron is as follows:

    fetchmail: Server CommonName mismatch: pop.mail.yahoo.com != plus.pop.mail.yahoo.com
    4818:error:14090086:SSL routines:SSL3_GET_SERVER_CERTIFICATE:certificate verify failed:s3_clnt.c:982:
    fetchmail: SSL connection failed. i
    fetchmail: socket error while fetching from <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/fetchmail-users">user at yahoo.com</A>@plus.pop.mail.yahoo.com
    fetchmail: Query status=2 (SOCKET)

If I use the following openssl command:

    openssl s_client -connect plus.pop.mail.yahoo.com:995 -CApath /etc/ssl/certs

The server certificate appears to verify OK.

In my testing, I've noticed a pattern where the error occurs and it is
repeatable, even from the command line.  But once I execute the openssl
command as above, that seems to uncork the system for a period of time,
thought not permanently as it does recur.  One thing I did note is that
when everything works, the server common name is seen as
*.pop.mail.yahoo.com, whereas when it doesn't the common name is as
pop.mail.yahoo.com.

Further background- I know that SSL works generally.  I have fetchmail
working with several other POP servers using SSL with the identical
sslcertpath setting.  (Note that the openssl command uses the same cert
path- just to make sure it's OK).  The Yahoo Plus account worked fine
for many years now, until this.  I did work with a Yahoo tech person for
a bit, but they weren't of much help.  I actually thought that Yahoo
might have created errant certificates, but after some searching, it
seems that the wildcard in the common name is allowed.

The output for 'env LC_ALL=C fetchmail -V' is attached as diag1 (I've
modified passwords and usernames to protect the innocent).  The output
for 'env LC_ALL=C fetchmail --nodetach -vvv --nosyslog' is included as
diag2- thought this particular grab does not show the error(I had
uncorked it using the openssl command).

I'll be happy to provide more information if you require it.

Regards-
Gerry LaMontagne
