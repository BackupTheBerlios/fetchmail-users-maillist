&gt;<i> [Correcting point 2]
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Matthias, please check if these points should be implemented:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - Stop redirecting rejected mails to postmaster as a last-resort address.
</I>
Possible for protocols that allow leaving messages on the server (POP3,
IMAP). Unsure for ODMR/ETRN/... because I'm not sure if we can reject
messages in a way that the server keeps them and will re-try delivery later.

Only suitable for 7.X.

&gt;<i> - If 'softbounce' and 'no bouncemail', do not send any bounce mail to the postmaster. (as suggested by Martin Koeppe)
</I>
Yes, makes perfect sense. Suitable for 6.3.X and 7.X.

&gt;<i> - Undo documentation on setting postmaster to empty string. Ignore 'set postmaster &quot;&quot;' silently (for compatibility).
</I>
Hm. I understand you've introduced a feature but not thoroughly
documented it. I'm not sure I understand what you're proposing.  So 'set
postmaster &quot;&quot;' was an overloaded feature to suppress postmaster mail,
and you propose to silently ignore this setting? What would fetchmail
use instead?  This reads as though the user would be pulled in for nasty
surprises though. :-/

&gt;<i> - Add a failsafe mode to fetchmail. It should be activated when the fetchmailrc is new (say, less than 1 week old). In failsafe mode, fetchmail will essentially activate softbounce. In daemon mode, after a week of running time, switch off the failsafe mode.
</I>
No, this is definitely in the &quot;nasty surprises&quot; category.  Definitely
not suitable for 6.3.  For 7.0, I want to get away from all the various
automatisms that work this way today and another way tomorrow.

Softbounce should default to on, which will probably settle a lot of the
issues already.

Anything else that needs to be decided on?

Who is going to pick which work? :)
