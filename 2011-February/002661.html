May I suggest &lt;<A HREF="http://www.fetchmail.info/fetchmail-FAQ.html#G3">http://www.fetchmail.info/fetchmail-FAQ.html#G3</A>&gt;?

Note that the rcfile syntax differs from the command line format in that the latter requires &quot;--&quot; before an option and the former requires that these be omitted and also &quot;set&quot; before some global options, and a particular ordering of server-options-before-user-options (per poll).

&gt;<i> It is for

Feel free to maintain fetchmailconf and port it to nwcurses. 

I plan to abandon it because I don't care to maintain a Tk based tool that is awkward to use, unsuitable for small screens in expert mode (think netbook) and has a user experience that was acceptable two decades ago, but not today.  However, I don't have the time to write/maintain a new tool for the foreseeable future.  The current fetchmailconf does NOT abstract the user interface from its functionality, so porting it to a command line interface would more or less amount to a rewrite.

&gt;<i> because at least 
</I>&gt;<i> that way to the extent fetchmailconf is kept current with working syntax a
</I>&gt;<i> user could run that and sort out incorrect syntax first then if that 
</I>&gt;<i> failed as a result of syntax outside of fetchmailconf's build capacity for
</I>&gt;<i> .fetchmailrc files users of this email list would probably have more 
</I>&gt;<i> intelligent questions to ask.
</I>
You're free to ask smart questions already, answering the three crucial points:

- what did you do? (i. e. show the configuration file with made-up passwords, the exact command line)
- what exactly did you get? (i. e. show the error messages/logging verbatim)
- what did you expect instead (unless that's obvious)?

Particular instructions in the FAQ, again, see &lt;<A HREF="http://www.fetchmail.info/fetchmail-FAQ.html#G3">http://www.fetchmail.info/fetchmail-FAQ.html#G3</A>&gt;.
