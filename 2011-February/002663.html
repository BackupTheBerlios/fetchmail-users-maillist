<PRE>According to the man page:

The -L &lt;filename&gt; or --logfile &lt;filename&gt; option (keyword: set logfile)
       is only effective when fetchmail is detached and in daemon  mode.  Note
       that  the  logfile  must exist before fetchmail is run, you can use the
       touch(1) command with the filename as its sole argument to create it.
       This option allows you to redirect status  messages  into  a  specified
       logfile  (follow  the  option  with  the logfile name).  The logfile is
       opened for append, so previous messages aren't deleted.  This  is  pri-
       marily  useful  for  debugging configurations. Note that fetchmail does
       not detect if the logfile is rotated, the logfile is only  opened  once
       when fetchmail starts. You need to restart fetchmail after rotating the
       logfile and before compressing it (if applicable).

I have had problems in the past with either forgetting to create the
log file prior to running fetchmail or creating it with the wrong user
or permissions, or rotating the file and not restarting fetchmail. I
doubt if I am the only one to have made those stupid mistakes either;
although it is possible.

Since fetchmail does notice if the config file has been changed and
takes the appropriate action if it has, why can it not also take the
same approach to its log file. Most programs I use create a log file if
it does not all ready exist. Why does fetchmail lack this ability?

Programs such as dovecot which are running as daemon have no problem if
there log file is rotated as long as they receive the correct signal
number; in this case &quot;30&quot;. Couldn't fetchmail be made to operate in a
similar manner?

By the way, I love fetchmail. I was just wondering why it seems to
operate in a manner not consistent with other *.nix products.
