&gt;<i> Folks,
</I>&gt;<i> I'm having a small issue that I need to workaround.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> All my mail arrives and resides in an MS Exchange 2007 mail box. I then use
</I>&gt;<i> fetchmail to get it from there, via IMAP4, send it through procmail to have
</I>&gt;<i> it filtered into folders etc, and then read it via mutt. It all works mostly
</I>&gt;<i> just fine and I like my setup a lot.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Recently, due to some IT screwup, all the mail that I had incrementally
</I>&gt;<i> fetched over the last few years have been lost. Thankfully, I left all my
</I>&gt;<i> mail on the server!
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Now, I have about 61K emails on the server :-(
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I decided to do a &quot;fetchmail -ak&quot;. But, it has failed the last 7 attempts,
</I>&gt;<i> some time after the low teen thousandth email, once after 13K once after 17K
</I>&gt;<i> emails etc. And it takes a long time to do this. Each time it fails, I &quot;rm
</I>&gt;<i> -rf ~/Mail/inbox&quot; and try again. But, it seems to me there has to be a
</I>&gt;<i> better way. Each time the error is some socket failure. I totally believe
</I>&gt;<i> this is probably a flaky mail server problem and has nothing to do with
</I>&gt;<i> fetchmail itself. Still, I need to find a way around it.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Here are some specific questions:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> a) is there a way I can tell fetchmail to fetch emails numbered 1 - 1000,
</I>&gt;<i> then 1001 - 2000 etc? The chances that there will be a socket error while
</I>&gt;<i> bringing in a 1000 emails is, let's see, about 60 times smaller than if I
</I>&gt;<i> asked it to fetch 60000 emails. I like those kind of odds.
</I>
Yes - check the manual page for fetchlimit - however...

&gt;<i> b) Ask fetchmail to retry without having it fetch the same mail repeatedly?
</I>&gt;<i> For instance, let us say I said &quot;fetchmail -ak&quot; and it failed at 13894th
</I>&gt;<i> email. I'd like to restart it and have it start fetching from the 13895th
</I>&gt;<i> email. Can this be done? How?
</I>
...this isn't too helpful with IMAP4 since fetchmail cannot track which
mails it has seen or not in this case, POP3 UIDL (then without -a) would
likely work better.

&gt;<i> c) Is there any other clever way?
</I>
Perhaps there are better tools for a one-time synchronization. offlineimap,
imapsync, getmail - one of these might work.
