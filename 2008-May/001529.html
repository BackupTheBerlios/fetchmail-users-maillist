&gt;<i> My question : Is there any possibility to send this notification back to

</I>&gt;<i> oversized and not delivered?
</I>
I don't mean to extend the delayed bounces issues by adding more
messages to be returned to sender, quite the opposite. We can certainly
discuss whether to fetch a truncated version or just headers or provide
some details in a later version, and deliver these to the final
recipient, but not to the sender.

&gt;<i> In the actual situation the sender believes that the mail was delivered
</I>&gt;<i> and the recipient knows there has been one message deleted but can&#180;t
</I>&gt;<i> inform the sender because he doesn&#180;t know who it was.
</I>
That's indeed a problem.

&gt;<i> Why in general doesn&#180;t fetchmail just get the mail from the server,
</I>&gt;<i> flush it, tries to deliver to the MTA, then when fetchmail gets a
</I>&gt;<i> negative respond (like message is oversized) generate a nondelivery mail
</I>&gt;<i> with the answer from the MTA and then  deletes or quarantines the
</I>&gt;<i> original mail?
</I>
fetchmail should generate as few messages by itself as possible. Leaving
the message on a server and sending a warning to the local site is
probably an option for POP3+UIDL, but not currently for IMAP, for lack
of UID support (patches pending but incomplete), and without
--limitflush, fetchmail is nearly there.

Feel free to ask more questions on this.
