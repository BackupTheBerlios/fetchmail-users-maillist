<PRE>Quoting from Brendan Lynch's mail on Thu, Mar 02, 2006:
&gt;<i> However I believe the servers is behaving correctly according to the 
</I>&gt;<i> IMAP spec: I have attached an explanation of the secondary problem I am 
</I>&gt;<i> seeing (extra 28 s wait) that I sent to Casper; let me know if you need 
</I>&gt;<i> more info.
</I>
Yes, I have now read RFC 3501 section 5.3. This behaviour is correct.

&gt;<i> The key point is that the imap_idle() code when 'faking' IDLE support 
</I>&gt;<i> calls imap_ok() (at line 637) without having issued any tagged command:
</I>
...

&gt;<i> Since there is no tagged command outstanding the server will not (and 
</I>&gt;<i> should not) ever send a tagged response.  If we set imap_ok to only 
</I>&gt;<i> return after a tagged response we are guaranteeing it will always only 
</I>&gt;<i> return after a timeout.
</I>
...

&gt;<i> This again first does a gen_transact() which results in sending &quot;A0130 
</I>&gt;<i> NOOP&quot; at 17:00:49.  A &quot;RECENT&quot; update is already on its way form the 
</I>&gt;<i> server, so we receive it before the &quot;A0130 NOOP completed&quot; at 17:00:49.  
</I>&gt;<i> In imap_ok() we first process the &quot;* 1 RECENT&quot; notification at line 117, 
</I>&gt;<i> setting recentcount, then (since we ARE waiting a tag) loop and process 
</I>&gt;<i> the NOOP ok.  we then return to gen_transact(), which in turn returns to 
</I>&gt;<i> imap_idle().
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Since setting &quot;recentcount&quot; does not also change the stage, we fail the 
</I>&gt;<i> test at line 633 of imap_idle() and continue to do an extra imap_ok() 
</I>&gt;<i> which sets a 28 second timer at 17:00:49 and does a recv() which times 
</I>&gt;<i> out at 17:01:17.  We then return from imap_idle() to imap_getrange() 
</I>&gt;<i> line 679.  At this point recentcount is set and we exit the &quot;while 
</I>&gt;<i> (recentcount == 0 &amp;&amp; do_idle)&quot; loop.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The wait between 17:00:49 and 17:01:17 was unnecessary, as already had 
</I>&gt;<i> our RECENT notification.  The second part of my fix causes imap_ok() to 
</I>&gt;<i> change the stage to STAGE_FETCH on receipt of a RECENT notification, 
</I>&gt;<i> just as it already did on receipt of a EXISTS notification. This causes 
</I>&gt;<i> the if condition &quot;if (ok != 0 || stage != STAGE_IDLE)&quot; to be met at line 
</I>&gt;<i> 633 of imap_idle() so it immediately exits and does not do the extra 
</I>&gt;<i> unneeded imap_ok() call.
</I>
Yes, you have diagnosed the problem correctly and your patch is also
correct. Based on your patch, I have prepared a new patch which does
not modify imap_ok(), but cleans up the code in imap_idle(). Could you
test this patch and see if this patch is acceptable to you? This patch
is identical to the patch I had sent to Casper Gripenberg, except that
comments relating to compliance with RFCs have been updated.
