<PRE>To explain, the thing is:

- you don't know if a site you Googled is the real CA site, so anyone
could present a rogue CA certificate that signed a rogue server
certificate, all with counterfeit issuer and subject - this needs to be
double-checked;

- many distributions (Debian, Ubuntu, OpenSUSE, Fedora) preinstall a
certain set of CA services, such as Equifax, Thawte, VeriSign, ... -
Mozilla, in relation to their &quot;NSS&quot; - also maintain a list of usually
trustworthy certificates, those that ship with FireFox and other Mozilla
products.  On FreeBSD, this is named ca_root_nss.

It might be easier and safe to rely on such a package and keep it
updated - IF it is supported and frequently updated by its provider.

It might also be a safer place to look for root certificates, and
usually requires less hoops to jump through with root certificate
conversions and all that.
