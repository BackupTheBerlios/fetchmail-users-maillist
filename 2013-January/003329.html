<PRE>Generally speaking, fetchmail retrieves mail from a mail server (gmail,
yahoo, your ISP) and then passes it off to whoever is listening locally
on port 25- which is (supposed to be!) an MTA such as postfix, exim,
sendmail.  These then route the mail to local users on the network and,
in turn, pass the mail off to and MDA (mail delivery agent) dovecot or
Courier or simply deposit it into a folder (sometime the spool dir,
sometimes a home dir).  From there, you read it with something like mutt
or Thunderbird, a mail reader basically.

To confuse matters a bit, the MTA's (exim, postfix, etc) can also send
mail directly to procmail or maildrop type programs, which are also
classified as MDA's.  Thus, one of the more confusing aspects of mail
delivery in 'nix systems is created- which MDA gets its hands on the
mail first, the mail filter or the &quot;true&quot; MDA, dovecot?

It sounds like your problem is the mail isn't being run through maildrop
as you expect.  I'm not familiar with the particulars of maildrop, but
as far as a place to look for solutions, you might want to see if you
can get postfix to deliver all mails to maildrop, which then hands off
everything to dovecot using dovecot's &quot;deliver&quot; command.  I have been
using this basic flow for years without issue, only I'm using exim
instead of postfix and procmail instead of maildrop.

As such, if you are at least receiving your mail, then your problem
isn't related to fetchmail.

Hope that helps.
