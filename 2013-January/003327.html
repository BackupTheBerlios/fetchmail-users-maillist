&gt;<i> &gt; DENY = &quot;^X-Originating-IP:.*199\.71\.233\.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; DENY = &quot;^Received:.*173\.242\.119\.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; DENY = &quot;^X-Originating-IP:.*69\.175\.70\.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; DENY = &quot;^Received:.*69\.25\.193\.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Note that in each of the above cases I am nuking that whole class D.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1) The notation would match a 'class C', not a D which was multicast.
</I>
Semantics, in this case a never mind to me.  Yes, I'm matching a class C, 
because I don't have a quarter to call somebody that might care.  Point 
being if a class D address that came from that class C is spam, then its 
likely that any other class D in that class C is also.

&gt;<i> 2) Would and was, because classful was replaced with CIDR in 1993.
</I>
Reference link that explains it in english please?

&gt;<i> 3) Blocking on class boundaries won't work as expected because,
</I>&gt;<i> again, CIDR assignments/BGP are how things are done and must
</I>&gt;<i> be looked up to meet expectation.
</I>&gt;<i> 4) Forget about classful addressing, please.
</I>
When it quits working.  That will be when I see FP's, which I haven't yet.  
Its worked well for quite a while now.  Within its limitations of course 
and it has at least one that upset me at the time.

I have conversed with the author, who apparently has no intentions of ever 
revisiting the code again.  Its written in C++, the spawn of the devil IMO, 
so I haven't spent more than an hour or so trying to understand it.

So I've wrapped it up in another bash script that handles the one big, 
sticks out like a bandaged hammered thumb problem it was giving me 2 years 
ago over a bug or non-rfc compliance in the QMail server.

Cheers, Gene

I know it all.  I just can't remember it all at once.
I was taught to respect my elders, but its getting 
harder and harder to find any...
