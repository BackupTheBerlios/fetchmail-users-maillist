<PRE>Hi
I am seeking advice on the overall process with *postfix* and *dovecot*
when fetchmail is configured to download mail, and then hand it over to
maildrop for delivery via the ../bin/mda command. I know that if postfix
is stopped, fetchmail complains that it can't deliver to the localhost. So
does this mean that postfix and dovecot are serving as middlemen here? I
am trying to better understand whats happening here.

If theres a simpler alternative, I am all ears. Roundcube is being used to
view the emails.

I'm not seeking a specific explanation at this stage as I am not certain
my problem is fetchmail related. I just what to better understand the
process and the order of processing. The problem is that my maildrop
filtering rules are not being followed when mail is downloaded, though
subsequently manually running the mis-delivered emails through the
maildrop program on command line sees the same emails delivered
*correctly* ie a regex MATCH is produced, as configured in the maildrop
mailfilter file. Perhaps a reason for this, as I noticed from the
fetchmail logs, is that headers on the emails are 're-written' on
delivery?

Am using maildir settings and as far as I can see, the ~/maildir
configuration is consistent across postfix, dovecot and maildrop.

Whats even more anomalous is the mail from one server *is* delivered as
expect, but not mail from a different server.

Thanks
Michael
