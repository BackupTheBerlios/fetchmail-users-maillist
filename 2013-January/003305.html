&gt;<i> Hi Matthias,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I got it working by re-configuring fetchmail with the --with-ssl option.
</I>&gt;<i> Just dropped a blog article on this subject for the benefit of others

WARNING - ACTION REQUIRED!

Please remove the &quot;Install SSL Certificates&quot; section from your blog
post, and please tell me where you've obtained that misguided
information, it needs to be purged.  If there are archives or you know
through pingbacks of other sites that have included your information,
please notify them to remove that, too.

If someone followed these instructions, please remove the server
certificates from the trust store.

In the best case, it will fail...

It describes a useless, dangerous procedure that creates a false sense
of security.  c_rehash does not &quot;verify&quot; certificates, and anyone who
follows your instructions can just as well disable SSL with no further
loss in security -- anyone who pastes server certificates, rather than
the CA certificates designated by the mail servers's operator, into his
trust store, is opening his SSL connection to eavesdropping.

You should have read README.SSL as shipped with recent fetchmail
tarballs; for your convenience, see
&lt;<A HREF="http://git.berlios.de/cgi-bin/cgit.cgi/fetchmail/tree/README.SSL?h=legacy_63">http://git.berlios.de/cgi-bin/cgit.cgi/fetchmail/tree/README.SSL?h=legacy_63</A>&gt;.

Perhaps I need to tighten SSL certificate validation even more...
