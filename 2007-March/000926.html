</I>&gt;<i> When I first started it (fetchmail, via system startup) it complained (from logs) that it could not find /etc/fetchmailrc.  Thinking that a typo, and having an &quot;aha&quot; moment regarding my above pondering, I copied my /root/.fetchmailrc to /etc/.  Alas, it still complained, so I renamed it, leaving off the leading &quot;.&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Now it seems to be quite happy reading /etc/fetchmailrc.  But I am not certain why.  Or if it is only reading that to find the &quot;real&quot; config file.  I hesitate to start hacking to find out, as it takes several minutes for this older Dell Poweredge to start up.  Boring.

My crystal ball tells me you're probably running some form of Linux
and have some version of fetchmail installed, possibly from a binary
package...

Seriously, if you want help you need to provide information.  At the
very least you need to fill in the blanks above.

Now, if you're running Linux then you'll most likely find the startup
script as /etc/init.d/fetchmail.  If you look at that script you'll
find what your package provider has set as the defaults for that
build.

Oh, and when any program complains about the lack of a given file,
it's unlikely to be a typo :)
