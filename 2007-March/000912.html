And that's the scary part.  What you're saying (though I doubt it's
what you mean to say) is that you've used socks so you can completely
bypass your organisations IT security policy regarding Internet
traffic.

&gt;<i> Well I think, at the end of the day it's &quot;the user's&quot; problem,
</I>&gt;<i> and I guess 99% of the fetchmail users employ a ready-made installation,

Sorry, but there is nothing either the author's or supporters of
fetchmail can do if distributors want to make their own non-standard
changes to fetchmail's configuration or compile in all the possible
libraries.  There is enough time taken up with helping people as it is
(not to mention the amount of time this thread has taken up).

I do agree that the socks situation could have been better documented,
both in the output of fetchmail's configdump and in the man page.
That however is within &quot;our&quot; control and is being resolved.

&gt;<i> Obviously everybody may have his/her own position on what is (un)comfortable in this respect.
</I>&gt;<i> But maybe &quot;relevance of positions&quot; should somehow relate to &quot;competence and experience in *the* area and *not* *just* in IT&quot;.
</I>
And an understanding that you're not always right, no matter how much
pain a problem may have caused you :)
