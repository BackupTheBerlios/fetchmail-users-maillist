That'll be because that's not what Fetchmail was designed to do.
Fetchmail is designed to download entire mailboxes or at least the
unread messages.  Without changes to the source there's no way to
download only the seen email.

It also doesn't delete email after N days (I'm pretty sure that's in
the FAQ - it certainly used to be).
