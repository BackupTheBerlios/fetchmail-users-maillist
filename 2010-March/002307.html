Hmm. For some reason I didn't think that would be necessary. That was 
silly of me. Output from &quot;env LC_ALL=C fetchmail --nodetach -vvv 
--nosyslog&quot; is attached.

Upon reviewing the information I spotted the LAST command. I'm actually 
downloading from 2 accounts: GMail and Yahoo. GMail doesn't support 
LAST, so it goes on to UIDL (which fetchmail stores in .fetchmailids). 
Yahoo supports both, but fetchmail just uses LAST. Why is LAST used in 
preference to UIDL? Everything I read says it's deprecated and a bad idea.

I guess I've answered one of my questions myself. &quot;Seen&quot; in the 
documentation is not the same as &quot;read&quot;. Perhaps the docs could be 
updated to clarify this. That said, in my understanding, if LAST is 
used, &quot;seen&quot; is by any POP client, so fetchmail may never have seen it. 
This seems undesirable.

The remaining question is how did it get into this state? Fetchmail is 
the only POP client that has ever been used on either of these accounts. 
Surely it should have downloaded and deleted these messages? I haven't 
been able to find any of these messages in the IMAP store, so I'm 
assuming that none of them were ever added, though it is possible that 
the users deleted them all. How likely is it that these are duplicates 
caused by something like fetchmail being killed for example?

Am I correct in thinking that there is no way of pushing these messages 
through fetchmail without them appearing as unread in the users mailbox?

Thanks.
Simon
