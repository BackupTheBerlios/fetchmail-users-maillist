<PRE>Greetings,

I am announcing the release of fetchmail 6.3.15.  This new stable
version of fetchmail adds the long-desired feature to download messages
with malformed headers (note this is disabled by default, see below for
details).

The software is available from:
&lt;<A HREF="http://developer.berlios.de/project/showfiles.php?group_id=1824">http://developer.berlios.de/project/showfiles.php?group_id=1824</A>&gt;

The fetchmail home pages are:
&lt;<A HREF="http://www.fetchmail.info/">http://www.fetchmail.info/</A>&gt;  or  &lt;<A HREF="http://fetchmail.berlios.de/">http://fetchmail.berlios.de/</A>&gt;

These are the relevant changes since the previous release.  Unless
otherwise noted, changes to this release were made by Matthias Andree:

fetchmail-6.3.15 (released 2010-03-28, 25572 LoC):

# FEATURE
* Fetchmail now supports a bad-header command line or rcfile option that takes
  exactly one argument, accept or reject (default).  This specifies how messages
  with bad headers retrieved from the current server are to be treated.

# BUG FIXES
* In the rcfile, recognize &quot;local&quot; as abbreviation for &quot;localdomains&quot;, as
  documented. The short form has not ever worked since this feature was added in
  January 1997. Reported by Fr&#233;d&#233;ric Marchal.
* Do not close stdout when using mda and &quot;bsmtp -&quot; at the same time.
* Log operating system errors when BSMTP writes fail.
* Fix verbose mode progress formatting regression from 6.3.10; SMTP trace lines
  were no longer on a line of their own. Reported by Melchior Franz.
* Check seteuid() return value and abort running MDA if switch fails.
* Set global flags in a consistent manner. Make --nosoftbounce and
  --nobounce work from command line (these used to work in rcfiles).
  Reported and fix confirmed working by N.J. Mann. (Sunil Shetye)
* Properly import h_errno declarations, even on systems where h_errno isn't a
  macro. (Adds ./configure check, fixes Cygwin dllimport warnings.)

# CHANGES
* The repository has been converted and moved from the Subversion (SVN) format
  kindly hosted by Graham Wilson over the past years to Git format hosted on
  Gitorious.org.  My deepest thanks to Graham Wilson for this service that
  kept us going when BerliOS's Subversion service was faulty in its early days.
* This opportunity was used to convert BRANCH_6-2 and BRANCH_1-9-9 to
  GnuPG-signed tags, as a sign that these are now closed.
* The outdated SVN trunk is now called &quot;oldtrunk&quot; in Git just to save the work
  for future reference. All development in the past few years was on BRANCH_6-3.
* master was branched from BRANCH_6-3.  BRANCH_6-3 is now obsolete (and in fact
  was also converted to a tag to record where the conversion from SVN to Git
  took place).
* &quot;make check&quot; now skips HTML validation if xmllint or XHTML DTD are missing.

# DOCUMENTATION
* Web site and documentation were adjusted to reflect the SVN-&gt;Git move.
* The fetchmail manual page is now much clearer on the user id switching
  (seteuid) when using --mda while running as the super user.

# TRANSLATION UPDATES, by language name
* [zh_CN] Chinese (Simplified), by Ji Zheng-Yu
* [cs]    Czech, by Petr Pisar
* [nl]    Dutch, by Erwin Poeze
* [fr]    French, by Fr&#233;d&#233;ric Marchal
* [de]    German
* [id]    Indonesian, by Andhika Padmawan
* [it]    Italian, by Vincenzo Campanella
* [ja]    Japanese, by Takeshi Hamasaki

By popular demand, diffs from the previous release have been omitted.
