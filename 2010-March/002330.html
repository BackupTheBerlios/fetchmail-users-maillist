<PRE>For the last time - keep it on the list.  Any future email directly
from you will be ignored.

To draw a real world comparison - you're worried about somebody
intercepting your post after the local postal service delivers it to
your house/mailbox.  What's stopping your post being read before that
point?

Frankly if you're worried about somebody reading your *unencrypted*
email then you're missing the point.  Your unencrypted email is sent
by the electronic version of a postcard - anybody along the route who
wants to read it can.  If you're really such an interesting person as
to have your email targeted for interception by others then you've got
plenty of other things to be worried about and should be talking to
the security staff at your organisation ;)

More to the point, if you are being targeted it's unlikely to be a
person sat there waiting for email to arrive.  Any interception would
be handled automatically (such as by creating a rule in your gmail
account to forward all incoming email) so how long the email sits on
the server for doesn't matter.

If you really want it to sit on your mail server for the least
possible time, use IMAP and IDLE support (documented in the man page).
 Polling your ISP every 30 seconds may just result in your ISP
throttling your connections since you're abusing their service.  If
you want to reduce the risk of others reading email sent to you then
ensure that all email sent to you is suitably encrypted using S/MIME
or PGP.  Note that you can't achieve that through technology, only
educating the people who send you email.
