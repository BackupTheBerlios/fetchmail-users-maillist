(I'm quoting from two messages here):

&gt;<i> I finally got round to checking today, and as I suspected there are
</I>&gt;<i> 80 old mails (all read) dating back to before I setup fetchmail. The
</I>&gt;<i> man page says (in the documentation for --all) that &quot;the  default is
</I>&gt;<i> to fetch only messages the server has not marked seen&quot;. Is &quot;seen&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> the same as &quot;read&quot;? Or is there some extra magic involved?
</I>
No magic.

&gt;<i> I ask because I'm sure that fetchmail has retrieved &quot;read&quot; mail
</I>&gt;<i> before. There must have been more than 80 emails in the box when I
</I>&gt;<i> started using fetchmail. Also, I just did a quick test- I used the
</I>&gt;<i> gmail interface to mark a message as &quot;read&quot; and then ran fetchmail.
</I>&gt;<i> It got downloaded. Why?
</I>
Because you appear to be using POP3 and there fetchmail is supposed to
track &quot;read&quot; by itself. However, as you discovered, that doesn't always
work.

&gt;<i> Are there extra rules for downloading that I'm missing? Maybe
</I>&gt;<i> something based on dates?
</I>
None unless you configure them (such as message size limits).

&gt;<i> Also, am I correct in thinking that there is no way of pushing these
</I>&gt;<i> messages through fetchmail without them appearing as unread in the
</I>&gt;<i> users mailbox?
</I>
Yes you are.  Technically, they are &quot;new&quot; messages, and there is no
standard way that fetchmail could tell through an MDA or SMTP or LMTP
server that it should stuff a &quot;read&quot; message into the mailbox.

&gt;<i> Upon reviewing the information I spotted the LAST command. I'm
</I>&gt;<i> actually downloading from 2 accounts: GMail and Yahoo. GMail doesn't
</I>&gt;<i> support LAST, so it goes on to UIDL (which fetchmail stores in
</I>&gt;<i> .fetchmailids). Yahoo supports both, but fetchmail just uses LAST.
</I>&gt;<i> Why is LAST used in preference to UIDL? Everything I read says it's
</I>&gt;<i> deprecated and a bad idea.
</I>
Because when we (meaning Rob, Graham, Sunil and yours truly) took over
fetchmail 6.2.5 and I was polishing it for 6.3.0 that had dozens
(literally) of bug fixes, I wanted it to be reasonably compatible to
6.2.5, so that nobody had weird excuses not to upgrade and ask for 6.2.X
releases. This meant 6.3.X would have to carry on using &quot;LAST&quot;.

Beyond that, &quot;UIDL&quot; doesn't scale in fetchmail if you have really full
mailboxes (thousands of messages kept) because the algorithms are
O(n^2) complexity (meaning that 10 times the messages, 100 times the
execution time).

Luckily CPUs have become quite fast, and I tweaked the implementation a
bit (without going for the major changes in data structures that would
allow far greater speedups), so it's barely noticeable today.

&gt;<i> I guess I've answered one of my questions myself. &quot;Seen&quot; in the
</I>&gt;<i> documentation is not the same as &quot;read&quot;. Perhaps the docs could be
</I>
It might appear to be used inconsistently, but I consider these
synonym(ou)s.

&gt;<i> updated to clarify this. That said, in my understanding, if LAST is
</I>&gt;<i> used, &quot;seen&quot; is by any POP client, so fetchmail may never have seen
</I>&gt;<i> it. This seems undesirable.
</I>
I concur. I'd guess that fetchmail 7.0 (much later, not even started)
would remove support for LAST altogether, have a quicker UIDL code and
also support UID on IMAP servers (it currently doesn't, but unlike POP3,
IMAP has a notion of if a message is &quot;\Seen&quot; or not).

&gt;<i> The remaining question is how did it get into this state? Fetchmail
</I>&gt;<i> is the only POP client that has ever been used on either of these
</I>&gt;<i> accounts.
</I>
&quot;LAST&quot; is whatever the server feels like presenting. I'd suggest to
check the &quot;uidl&quot; option (in the rcfile) or --uidl on the command line.
More on state below.

&gt;<i> Surely it should have downloaded and deleted these
</I>&gt;<i> messages? I haven't been able to find any of these messages in the
</I>&gt;<i> IMAP store, so I'm assuming that none of them were ever added,
</I>&gt;<i> though it is possible that the users deleted them all. How likely is
</I>&gt;<i> it that these are duplicates caused by something like fetchmail
</I>&gt;<i> being killed for example?
</I>
Quite possible, especially &quot;not flushed&quot; symptoms can happen in such
situations.

Fetchmail will do this for each message:

1. if the message was unseen, retrieve it and pass it to SMTP/LMTP/MDA.

2. if not running with &quot;--keep&quot;, send a delete request for the message
   /JUST RETRIEVED/. This doesn't become effective before fetchmail
   sends &quot;QUIT&quot; (unless the server violates the POP3 standards, which
   some are known to do in an ill-advised ISP attempt to prevent users
   from keeping messages on the server).

Now, if fetchmail, or the POP3 connection, gets interrupted before the
server has received and processed the &quot;QUIT&quot;, the message is skipped.

You CAN have fetchmail delete seen messages from the server with
--flush, but use with caution, and never without --uidl.


For purposes of tracking &quot;Seen&quot; flags and thereabouts on IMAP servers,
consider offlineimap or imapsync for now. I have used neither, but have
read reports that they both serve their advertised purpose.
