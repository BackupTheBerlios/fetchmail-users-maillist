<PRE>Greetings,

in an effort to get sufficient testing, I have released the next alpha
version of fetchmail 7.0.0. This merges post-6.3.20 changes in, to
fix security (CVE-2012-3482) and otherwise important bugs; I am
including the changelog below.

7.0.0-alpha2+MAPI was not vulnerable to CVE-2011-3389.

The snapshot is without MAPI this time, because I cannot test the MAPI feature.

If you want to help out, please arrange an Exchange account for me that
I can send test messages to that I can retrieve via MAPI and IMAP.

The alpha version isn't available through BerliOS, but only from this
DOWNLOAD: &lt;<A HREF="http://home.pages.de/~mandree/fetchmail/">http://home.pages.de/~mandree/fetchmail/</A>&gt;

The corresponding git tag is SNAPSHOT_7-0-0-alpha3, the branch is
&quot;master&quot;. The repository is at &lt;<A HREF="http://gitorious.org/fetchmail">http://gitorious.org/fetchmail</A>&gt;.

Please send feedback to <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/fetchmail-users">fetchmail-devel at lists.berlios.de.</A>

Happy fetches!
Matthias

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
fetchmail-7.0.0 (not yet released):

NOTE THIS IS AN ALPHA RELEASE THAT HAS NOT BEEN THOROUGHLY TESTED!

# MAJOR CHANGES
* The UIDL handler code is now much faster, especially noticable with lots of
  mail kept on a POP3 server. Where the 6.3.X code was of O(n^2) complexity,
  we're down to O(n log n).
  Contributed by Rainer Weikusat, MAD Partners Ltd./MSS GmbH.
* The POP3 code now always uses UIDL, except if &quot;fetchall&quot; is in effect.
  Fixes BerliOS Bug #16172. Fixes Debian Bug#345788.
* Fetchmail now enables SSL support by default. If this is undesired,
  ./configure --without-ssl should help.
* The OpenSSL code now excludes the SSL_OP_DONT_INSERT_EMPTY_FRAGMENTS option.
  This can cause interoperability problems with certain buggy servers, but is
  required to defang chosen-plaintext attacks against AES.  While probably hard
  to mount against fetchmail, let's play it safe rather than be sorry later.

# FEATURES ADDED
* Fetchmail can now retrieve credentials from PWMD. This needs to be enabled at
  compile-time and requires run-time configuration. See README.PWMD for details.
  Contributed by Ben Kibbey, author of libpwmd and pwmd.
* Fetchmail now supports a retrieve-error command line or rcfile option that
  takes exactly one argument, abort (default), continue or markseen.  This
  specifies the policy used by fetchmail to handle messages whose bodies
  fail to be retrieved due to server errors.  Both the continue and markseen
  options will skip the message with errors and allow the session to
  continue so that subsequent messages can be retrieved.  The markseen
  option will also mark the message with errors as seen.
  The default policy is to abort the session whenever a server error occurs.
  Contributed by Craig Brown.
* Fetchmailconf offers cram-md5 and apop authentication.

# REMOVED FEATURES
* IMAP2 protocol support was removed.
* POP2 protocol support was removed.
* RPOP (not actually a protocol, but a variant of POP3) was removed
* POP3: the uidl option has been removed. It is always on.
* POP3: LAST is no longer used. It was removed from POP3 in 1994, and it could
  cause mail loss when the connection was interrupted or if clients besides
  fetchmail polled the mailbox.
* Trio was removed, fetchmail expects reasonable stdio.h quality levels.
* Support for systems that do not conform to C89 and POSIX 2001 was removed,
  this means that BeOS, EMX, NeXTSTEP quirks are no longer worked around.
* The MX and host alias DNS lookups that fetchmail performs in multidrop mode
  have been removed. They were based on the mistaken assumption that the
  IMAP/POP3 server was also the MX server, which is rarely the case.  They have
  never supported IPv6 (including IPv6-mapped IPv4) either.
  Non-DNS based alias keywords such as &quot;aka&quot; remain.
* Kerberos IV support was removed.
* fetchmail no longer supports SSL v2, nor the corresponding SSL2 option to
  --sslproto. SSLv2 is insecure and had been deprecated 15 years ago. fetchmail
  will actively forbid SSLv2 negotiation by means of SSL_OP_NO_SSLv2.
  To fix Debian Bug#622054.
* A lot of outdated and/or unsafe-to-use material got dropped from contrib/.

# REGRESSION FIXES
* The mimedecode feature now properly detects multipart/mixed-type matches, so
  that quoted-printable-encoded multipart messages can get decoded.
  (Regression in 5.0.0 on 1999-03-27, as a side effect of a PGP-mimedecode fix
  attributed to Henrik Storner.)

# BUG FIXES
* The mimedecode feature failed to ship the last line of the body if it was
  encoded as quoted-printable and had a MIME soft line break in the very last
  line.  Reported by Lars Hecking in June 2011.
  Bug introduced on 1998-03-20 when the mimedecode support was added by ESR
  before release 4.4.1 through code contributed by Henrik Storner.
  Workaround for older releases: do not use mimedecode feature.
* Fetchmail now detects singly-quoted % expansions in the mda option and refuses
  to deliver for safety reasons. Fixes Debian Bug#347909.
* The Server certificate: message in verbose mode now appears on stdout like the
  remainder of the output. Reported by Henry Jensen, to fix Debian Bug #639807.

# CHANGES
* A foreground fetchmail can now accept a few more options while another copy is
  running in the background.
* APOP is no longer a protocol, but an authentication method. In order to use
  it, use protocol POP3 auth APOP, or on the commandline, -p pop3 --auth apop.
  If no authentication method is specified, APOP is automatically tried if
  offered by the server before we resort to sending the password as clear text.

# KNOWN BUGS AND WORKAROUNDS
  (This section floats upwards through the NEWS file so it stays with the
  current release information)
* Fetchmail does not handle messages without Message-ID header well
  (See sourceforge.net bug #780933)
* BSMTP is mostly untested and errors can cause corrupt output.
* Sun Workshop 6 (SPARC) is known to miscompile the configuration file lexer in
  64-bit mode.  Either compile 32-bit code or use GCC to compile 64-bit
  fetchmail.  Note that fetchmail doesn't take advantage of 64-bit code,
  so compiling 32-bit SPARC code should not cause any difficulties.
* Fetchmail does not track pending deletes across crashes.
* The command line interface is sometimes a bit stubborn, for instance,
  fetchmail -s doesn't work with a daemon running.
* Linux systems may return duplicates of an IP address in some circumstances if
  no or no global IPv6 addresses are configured.
  (No workaround. Ubuntu Bug#582585, Novell Bug#606980.)
* Kerberos 5 may be broken, particularly on Heimdal, and provide bogus error
  messages. This will not be fixed, because the maintainer has no Kerberos 5
  server to test against. Use GSSAPI.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

fetchmail-6.3.23 (not yet released)

# NOTE THAT THE RELEASE OF FUTURE FETCHMAIL 6.3.X VERSIONS IS UNCLEAR.
Should a 7.0 release be made earlier, chances are that the 6.3.X branch
is abandoned and its changes be folded into the 7.0 release, with changes
after 6.3.22 not available on their own in a newer 6.3.X release.

# REGRESSION FIXES
* Fix compilation with OpenSSL implementations before 0.9.8m that lack
  SSL_CTX_clear_options. Patch by Earl Chew.
  Note that the use of older OpenSSL versions with fetchmail is unsupported and
  *not* recommended.

# BUG FIXES
* Fix combination of --plugin and -f -. Patch by Alexander Zangerl,
  to fix Debian Bug#671294.


fetchmail-6.3.22 (released 2012-08-29, 26077 LoC):

# SECURITY FIXES
* for CVE-2012-3482:
  NTLM: fetchmail mistook an error message that the server sent in response to
  an NTLM request for protocol exchange, tried to decode it, and crashed while
  reading from a bad memory location.
  Also, with a carefully crafted NTLM challenge packet sent from the server, it
  would be possible that fetchmail conveyed confidential data not meant for the
  server through the NTLM response packet.
  Fix: Detect base64 decoding errors, validate the NTLM challenge, and abort
  NTLM authentication in case of error.
  See fetchmail-SA-2012-02.txt for further details.
  Reported by J. Porter Clark.

* for CVE-2011-3389:
  SSL/TLS (wrapped and STARTTLS): fetchmail used to disable a countermeasure
  against a certain kind of attack against cipher block chaining initialization
  vectors (SSL_OP_DONT_INSERT_EMPTY_FRAGMENTS).
  Whether this creates an exploitable situation, depends on the server and the
  negotiated ciphers.
  As a precaution, fetchmail 6.3.22 enables the countermeasure, by clearing
  SSL_OP_DONT_INSERT_EMPTY_FRAGMENTS.

  NOTE that this can cause connections to certain non-conforming servers to
  fail, in which case you can set the environment variable
  FETCHMAIL_DISABLE_CBC_IV_COUNTERMEASURE to any non-empty value when starting
  fetchmail to re-instate the compatibility option at the expense of security.

  Reported by Apple Product Security.

  For technical details, refer to &lt;<A HREF="http://www.openssl.org/~bodo/tls-cbc.txt">http://www.openssl.org/~bodo/tls-cbc.txt</A>&gt;.
  See fetchmail-SA-2012-01.txt for further details.

# BUG FIX
* The Server certificate: message in verbose mode now appears on stdout like the
  remainder of the output. Reported by Henry Jensen, to fix Debian Bug #639807.

* The GSSAPI-related autoconf code now matches gssapi.c better, and uses
  a different check to look for GSS_C_NT_HOSTBASED_SERVICE.
  This fixes the GSSAPI-enabled build on NetBSD 6 Beta.

# CHANGES
* On systems where SSLv2_client_method isn't defined in OpenSSL (such as
  newer Debian, and Ubuntu starting with 11.10 oneiric ocelot), don't
  reference it (to fix the build) and if configured, print a run-time error
  that the OS does not support SSLv2. Fixes Debian Bug #622054,
  but note that that bug report has a more thorough patch that does away with
  SSLv2 altogether.

* The security and errata notices fetchmail-{EN,SA}-20??-??.txt are now
  under the more relaxed CC BY-ND 3.0 license (the noncommercial clause
  was dropped). The Creative Commons address was updated.

* The Python-related Makefile.am parts were simplified to avoid an automake
  1.11.X bug around noinst_PYTHON, Automake Bug #10995.

* Configuring fetchmail without SSL now triggers a configure warning,
  and asks the user to consider running configure --with-ssl.

# WORKAROUND
* Some servers, notably Zimbra, return A1234 987 FETCH () in response to
  a header request, in the face of message corruption.  fetchmail now treats
  these as temporary errors. Report and Patch by Mikulas Patocka, Red Hat.

* Some servers, notably Microsoft Exchange, return &quot;A0009 OK FETCH completed.&quot;
  without any header in response to a header request for meeting reminder
  messages (with a &quot;meeting.ics&quot; attachment). fetchmail now treats these as
  transient errors.  Report by John Connett, Patch by Sunil Shetye.

fetchmail-6.3.21 (released 2011-08-21, 26011 LoC):

# CRITICAL BUG FIX
* The IMAP client no longer inserts NUL bytes into the last line of a message
  when it is not closed with a LF or CRLF sequence. Reported by Antoine Levitt.
  As a side effect of the fix, and in order to avoid a full rewrite, fetchmail
  will now CRLF-terminate the last line fetched through IMAP, even if it is
  originally not terminated by LF or CRLF. This bears no relevance if your
  messages end up in mbox, but adds line termination for storages (like Maildir)
  that do not require that the last line be LF- or CRLF-terminated.

# CONTRIB/ addition
* There is a patch against fetchnews's source, contrib/rawlog.patch, that can
  log (and hexdump non-printing characters) raw socket data to a file. It proved
  useful to debug Antoine's bug described above.
