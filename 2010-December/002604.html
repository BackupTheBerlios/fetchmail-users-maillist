<PRE>Greetings,

in an effort to get sufficient testing, I have released the first alpha
version of fetchmail 7.0.0.

The alpha version isn't available through BerliOS, but only from
DOWNLOAD: &lt;<A HREF="http://home.pages.de/~mandree/fetchmail/">http://home.pages.de/~mandree/fetchmail/</A>&gt;

The corresponding git tag is SNAPSHOT_7-0-0-alpha1, the branch is
&quot;next&quot;.

Please send feedback to <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/fetchmail-users">fetchmail-devel at lists.berlios.de.</A>

Happy fetching!
Matthias

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

fetchmail-7.0.0 (not yet released):

NOTE THIS IS AN ALPHA RELEASE THAT HAS NOT BEEN THOROUGHLY TESTED!

# MAJOR CHANGES
* The UIDL handler code is now much faster, especially noticable with lots of
  mail kept on a POP3 server. Where the 6.3.X code was of O(n^2) complexity,
  we're down to O(n log n).
  Contributed by Rainer Weikusat, MAD Partners Ltd./MSS GmbH.
* The POP3 code now always uses UIDL, except if &quot;fetchall&quot; is in effect.
  Fixes BerliOS Bug #16172.

# FEATURES ADDED
* Fetchmail can now retrieve credentials from PWMD. This needs to be enabled at
  compile-time and requires run-time configuration. See README.PWMD for details.
  Contributed by Ben Kibbey, author of libpwmd and pwmd.
* Fetchmail now supports a retrieve-error command line or rcfile option that
  takes exactly one argument, abort (default), continue or markseen.  This
  specifies the policy used by fetchmail to handle messages whose bodies
  fail to be retrieved due to server errors.  Both the continue and markseen
  options will skip the message with errors and allow the session to
  continue so that subsequent messages can be retrieved.  The markseen
  option will also mark the message with errors as seen.
  The default policy is to abort the session whenever a server error occurs.
  Contributed by Craig Brown.

# REMOVED FEATURES
* POP2 was removed
* RPOP (not actually a protocol, but a variant of POP3) was removed
* POP3: the uidl option has been removed. It is no longer configurable.
* POP3: LAST is no longer used. It was removed from POP3 in 1994, and it could
  cause mail loss.
* Trio was removed, fetchmail expects reasonable stdio.h support levels.
* Support for systems that do not conform to C89 and POSIX 2001 was removed,
  this means that BeOS, EMX, NeXTSTEP quirks are no longer worked around.
* The MX and host alias DNS lookups that fetchmail performs in multidrop mode
  have been removed. They were based on the mistaken assumption that the
  IMAP/POP3 server was also the MX server, which is rarely the case.  They have
  never supported IPv6 (including IPv6-mapped IPv4) either.
  Non-DNS based alias keywords such as &quot;aka&quot; remain.
* Kerberos IV support was removed.

# CHANGES
* fetchmail now always uses its own MD5 implementation.  The library and header
  variants are too diverse, and we've been bitten before -- and configure
  complains noisily on Cyrus-SASL's RFC1321 md5.h.
