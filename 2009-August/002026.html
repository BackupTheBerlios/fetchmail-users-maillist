<PRE>Hi :) Folks in that ticket appear to be misunderstanding things
about the underlying crypto and why fingerprints are a necessary
safety check.

If one simply relies on checking the cert chain and blindly trusts
that model, as most of the world is conditioned to believe it is
sound, you are open to attack. Namely, of the sort in the posted
url, it is a good read, as are the referenced prior art. Both MD5
and SHA1 are theory broken and MD5 demonstrably so, as noted in the
literatre. So the hash part is of concern, at least in this case.

A CA takes a MD5 over certain fields in the cert and signs that MD5
digest, not the entire cert contents. CA's previously used MD5 and
failed to change their cert practices to SHA1 until a real world
break, oops. Anyways... So I don't have to swipe their private key.
All I have to do to forge a server cert is copy the signature from
any candidate real cert into my cert and manufacture the rest of
my cert contents so that they: a) work, b) make the fields have the
same digest as the real one. Which, as we all know by now is possible,
given time or new art, due to the whole hash collision thing.

However... if I copy a known good cert via trusted channels, and
take both the MD5 and SHA1 fingerprints of the DER form of that
cert, it's much closer to cryptographically impossible to manufacture
a cert that would match evarything. I could just as easily make
formal contact with the cert holder and get the prints that way or
receive them as part of a high security programme. Banks do this.

So there are two different fingerprints covering different areas.

Checking fingerprints over the entire DER cert will foil this attack
because it detects the contents that I manipulated to match the
field digest that was later signed. That is why openssl, browsers,
ssh, etc provide fingerprint calculating and verification functions...
totally separate from signature calc/verif capabilities.

So two types of checks should always be performed for maximum
security:

 A) cert chain trust = sig(hash(contents)) -&gt; pki
  This is done with openssl verify -verbose
  aka: sslcertck
 B) DER fingerprint = hash(sig(hash(contents))
  This is done with openssl x509 -in &lt;PEMcert&gt; -noout -fingerprint -&lt;sha1|md5&gt;
   or
  openssl x509 -in &lt;PEMcert&gt; -outform DER | &lt;sha1|md5&gt;
  aka: sslfingerprint... with the enhancements in the prior note

Enhancing fetchmail to doubly check B with both MD5 and SHa1 shouldn't
be much extra coding or user effort. As an aside, it's fairly common
to find places using/publishing both hashes for various purposes.

Removing the check in B places all the beans on the hash function
in A, which is not good. Private keys are not even involved in this.
Defense in depth will save your butt :)

Give the user tools, let them decide how many they wish to deploy
and manage. I would adapt the docs to say that one should use both
A and B, or neither, with some short reasons why. And continue to
provide example openssl usage as is there now, to allow them to
accomplish it.

Note1: Not checking the fingerprints on self-signed certs... such
as are commonly found in internal corporate nets, edu's, org's, and
the many end user, developer, hacker and other low budget/tier
sites... is asking for trouble. Not publishing your prints, signed
by OpenPGP, is bad too.

Note2: The random serial fix just helps eliminate easier forms of
the hash collision attack, see the paper. It doesn't necessarily
prevent other forms or completely new math attacks, and definitely
doesn't prevent brute force.

Note3: The lists.berlios.de cert is expired, and MD5, though that
doesn't matter :) The Berlios_CA cert may be self-signed.

Hey, thanks for the pointer to the bug thing! I'll try to append
to the seemingly closed ticket. I'm out of time at the moment to
help out with correcting what is already in there, perhaps later.

And again for keeping up with all the maintenance to fetchmail :)
