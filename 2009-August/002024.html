<PRE>Hi all :)

Fetchmail needs the ability to specify multiple 'sslfingerprint'
options and digests per 'poll' stanza.

I noticed this when connecting to gmail. I think it's a load sharing
thing providers use. Google also has their own intermediate CA now
so more cert deployments could be expected.

At the moment, if you specify multiple sslfingerprint rc lines or
command line options, only the last one specified is checked. Any
prior sslfingerprint options are silently ignored. And the only
digest available is md5.

This is obviously frustrating users mail collection attempts :(


To reproduce the problem, run this and examine the certs and hashes.
The gmail certs happen to verify back to the root CA's. The
44a8...f1a9 cert occurs more frequently, the 9273...9f33 cert is
rarer. I've attached them both and the CA's involved.

If you are not seeing multiple certs, you may need to 'travel' and
debug with different source ip addresses... such as provided with
a worldwide proxy network like Tor.

i=10 ; while : ; do
 LD_PRELOAD=/tmp/tor/libtsocks.so.1 TSOCKS_CONF_FILE=/tmp/tor/tsocks.conf \
  openssl s_client -connect pop.gmail.com:pop3s &lt; /dev/null &gt; tcert$i 2&gt;&amp;1
 echo -n &quot;$i: &quot;
 openssl x509 -noout -fingerprint -md5 -in tcert$i
 i=`expr $i + 1`
done


Also related... from the BRANCH_6-3 NEWS file:

* --sslfingerprint may be removed from a future fetchmail version,
 because it's just too easily abused to create a false sense of
 security.

PLEASE don't remove this feature. I like it a lot and use it
everywhere possible, with --ssl and --sslcertck at the same time
as well, from trusted sources beforehand of course. Knowing when
the cert changes out from under you is very useful, even if only
for debugging or system verification. Especially if you connect
from untrusted locations or paths. Or you want to know about and
resolve them. It's also handy if the machine a user is connecting
from has a poor, untrusted or nonexistent collection of CA certs.
In that case, just the digest can be imported and used. Note that
openssl does not ship with a CA cert collection... admins usually
have to get it from mozilla... if they value PKI enough to think
of and bother with it.

There are blurbs in the man page that even talk about self-signed
certs being accepted with 'sslcertck'.


Overall, it would be good to see this feature enhanced to do both
md5 and sha1 to make cert collision attacks much more improbable
going forward... at least until the NIST 'SHA-3' hash competition
is done and that trickles down to the CA's and apps years from now.
Usage in the case of a single cert, where both must match, might
be like...

poll
 sslfingerprint-md5 &lt;fp_md5&gt;
 sslfingerprint-sha1 &lt;fp_sha1&gt;

In the case where multiple certs may be presented, group the hashes
as a set. Both hashes in the set must match. First check set cert1,
then set cert2, then set cert[n] until one set, or none, match the
presented cert...

poll
 sslfingerprint-cert1-md5 &lt;fp_md5&gt;
 sslfingerprint-cert1-sha1 &lt;fp_sha1&gt;
 sslfingerprint-cert2-md5 &lt;fp_md5&gt;
 sslfingerprint-cert2-sha1 &lt;fp_sha1&gt;
 sslfingerprint-cert[n]-md5 &lt;fp_md5&gt;
 sslfingerprint-cert[n]-sha1 &lt;fp_sha1&gt;

The '--' command line version of this should also do the right
thing.

Fetchmail should also print both the md5 and sha1 fingerprints from
the received certificate in the debug output.

Note that openssl supports mdc2, md2, md5, sha1. I understand that
some CA's also used, or may still use, the non-sha1 digests. Though
I guess sha1 is the only one used by sane CA's for new certs these
days. I don't know how many old ones are still in use on hosts. md5
and sha1 are enough until SHA-3.

And since the past always seems to apply to some future scenario
with new twists, this is surely not the last of the breed to be
proven out: <A HREF="http://www.win.tue.nl/hashclash/rogue-ca/">http://www.win.tue.nl/hashclash/rogue-ca/</A>

Extra checks are always good thing to have available.
Openssl probably has simple library routines to do this.

Thanks guys, and for fetchmail too, been using it for years :)
