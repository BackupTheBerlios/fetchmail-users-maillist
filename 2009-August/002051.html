<PRE>Hello list. I apologize if some of this is slightly off-topic; if so,
perhaps some kind soul would point me in a more suitable direction.

Simplistically, I have a Linux server (which does a variety of things) and
several WinXP client computers. At the moment, I run POP3 and SMTP proxies
(pop3proxy and smtpproxy) on the server, and point client Outlook
installations at those proxies. I pop mail from my ISP via those proxies,
and send using SMTP. There are several different e-mail accounts with the
ISP that are accessed in this way.

I want to move away from client-based PST files and towards server-hosted
mail. At the moment, I don't want to go all the way with a full MTA
configuration, for several reasons.

If I understand fetchmail correctly, it will allow me to regularly poll my
ISP and pop mail for all of my e-mail accounts, and interact with mail
server software on my server to place mail in the appropriate directories. I
presumably can then run other software to allow the client Outlook
installations to access the server-based e-mail using IMAP. I presume I can
rely on some sort of MTA functionality on my server to continue to send
outbound SMTP mail to my ISP.

With that as a summary of what I'd like to do, I would be very grateful if
someone would conceptually walk me through how this might work, and what
software would be applicable at what stages. I'm not after a detailed
explanation of how to configure the software, but rather a general overview
of how it would all work together and what role each software would play. I
am a complete newbie when it comes to implementing and using mail server
software.

Any and all help is gratefully welcome.
