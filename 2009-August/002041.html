<PRE>Hi James,

</I>&gt;<i> It results in a bunch of email messages I don't want that include the

</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Is there a way I can stop getting an email every time Fetchmail starts?
</I>
Maybe - that depends on how exactly your cron line looks like - can you  
show that?
I suspect there are some verbose options - and cron will dutifully mail  
the verbose output. So if you request it, you'll get it.

You can also filter particular lines out by piping fetchmail output  
through grep -v or sed (perhaps you also need a 2&gt;&amp;1 before the pipe  
symbol so that stderr gets filtered, too), or you can redirect fetchmail's  
output to a file, either by regular shell means (even in crontab), or  
through the logfile option (if you're using fetchmail's daemon mode on the  
crontab line).

&gt;<i> At least with what I am capable of doing - and I'm a relatively  
</I>&gt;<i> experienced Linux user - over 5 years and this additional step, beyond  
</I>&gt;<i> all of the other things is, its becoming too much.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ***Your users really should be allowed to disable this***
</I>
Euh, disable what? The message? I'm not getting anything like it for my  
SSL servers unless I request verbose output.

&gt;<i> ...because it is very difficult to deal with unless you are well versed  
</I>&gt;<i> in ssl - or maybe not I don't know -
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It seems like a problem with Fetchmail.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Most users aren't well versed with SSL. I'm barely grasping this - and  
</I>&gt;<i> amongst the other responsibilities I have and other complex things I had  
</I>&gt;<i> to learn to set up other programs on the server that this appears on -  
</I>&gt;<i> unbelievable.
</I>
fetchmail's packaged README.SSL document (plain text) could help  
understanding things, but perhaps not your current issue (I'm not sure if  
it's SSL, fetchmail, or your crontab line that causes this).

&gt;<i> I've no idea if, because I have some files in /etc/ssl/certs the problem  
</I>&gt;<i> occurs or what. That's the only way I can imagine Fetchmail isn't the  
</I>&gt;<i> problem.
</I>
Unfortunately, you appear to have massively made up information (such as  
server names and IPs), so it is impossible to check what's really up.

&gt;<i> I have in my ~/.fetchmailrc file:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ...
</I>&gt;<i> poll frustration.com with proto pop3
</I>&gt;<i> ...
</I>
&gt;<i> I get:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> fetchmail -v
</I>&gt;<i> fetchmail: 6.3.11 querying frustrated.com (protocol POP3) at Sun Aug 23  
</I>&gt;<i> 21:33:56 2009: poll started
</I>&gt;<i> Trying to connect to 123.456.78.91/995...connected.
</I>
As we can see, there is a mismatch between your poll line and what you  
claim fetchmail reports, and the IPv4 address is invalid.

&gt;<i> This is so complicated that its hard to figure out if there is a bug -  
</I>&gt;<i> you are lucky if someone reports it!
</I>
You've made it hard to figure out.

If you want any serious advice, do not make up hostnames and IP addresses.

Thank you.
