<PRE>Hi Rob - thanks for your reply.

&gt;&gt;<i> If I understand fetchmail correctly, it will allow me to regularly poll
</I>my
&gt;&gt;<i> ISP and pop mail for all of my e-mail accounts, and interact with mail
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> server software on my server to place mail in the appropriate
</I>directories. I
&gt;&gt;<i> presumably can then run other software to allow the client Outlook
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> installations to access the server-based e-mail using IMAP. I presume I
</I>can
&gt;&gt;<i> rely on some sort of MTA functionality on my server to continue to send
</I>.&gt; outbound SMTP mail to my ISP.

&gt;<i> Sort of.  Fetchmail allows you to retrieve email from your ISP (and
</I>&gt;<i> any other POP/IMAP servers) and pass it to your local SMTP server.  It
</I>&gt;<i> is up to your SMTP server what happens next.
</I>
&gt;&gt;<i> With that as a summary of what I'd like to do, I would be very grateful
</I>if
&gt;&gt;<i> someone would conceptually walk me through how this might work, and what
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> software would be applicable at what stages. I'm not after a detailed
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> explanation of how to configure the software, but rather a general
</I>overview
&gt;&gt;<i> of how it would all work together and what role each software would play.
</I>I
&gt;&gt;<i> am a complete newbie when it comes to implementing and using mail server
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> software.
</I>
&gt;<i> There is no shortage of information out there on this subject.  Throw
</I>&gt;<i> appropriate words into any search engine and you'll get a host of
</I>&gt;<i> pages taking you through the process.  You'll need to make 2
</I>&gt;<i> decisions:
</I>
Well, at the risk of sounding extremely unknowledgeable about the subject
(but that's only because I am), I can attest that I've thrown lots of
appropriate words into search engines and retrieved lots of pages on the
subject. The challenge I've encountered is that every page I've come across
presumes I already have a basic understanding of how e-mail works,
technically and mechanically, at every stage of the process and how the
various software pieces fit together. As my post explained, that's not
necessarily an accurate assumption. I'm fairly technically adept, but I want
to make sure I'm starting with a correct conceptual overview so as to
minimize my own confusion as I walk through the process.

&gt;<i> 1) What SMTP software you want to use (Sendmail, Postfix, Exim, or others)
</I>
So, here's a good example. Do I need to use SMTP software in the first
place? I will not be using SMTP to retrieve mail from my ISP, but rather
want to continue (at least in the near term) to continue to pop it. The
reasons are simple: I believe my ISP blocks inbound port 25 (yes, I'm aware
I can probably substitute another port), and there are anecdotal stories of
my ISP terminating accounts for residential users who run servers
(particularly mail servers). Until I can ascertain the truth of that (and if
it turns out to be untrue, I will want to go the rest of the way and set up
an MX record for my mail server and proceed with receiving SMTP mail), my
plans are to stick to the process that works now and pop mail from them.
Rather than have each mail client be responsible for doing that, though,
through my existing proxy, I want something to take care of it on behalf of
all my mail clients and store the mail centrally on my server. It is my
understanding that Fetchmail will take care of the pop angle; do I need an
SMTP server with which Fetchmail will interact, in order to &quot;store&quot; the
mail, and as well in order to take care of &quot;storing&quot; outbound SMTP mail from
the mail clients (and, for that matter, sending the outbound SMTP mail to my
ISP)?

&gt;<i> 2) What IMAP/POP software you want to use (UWash, Courier, Cyrus or
</I>others)

So, because I want to store mail centrally on my server, I presume I will
need to set up IMAP capability on the server, with which my Outlook mail
clients will interact to view the mail. I've briefly looked at Courier,
which also seems to be a fully-fledged SMTP server as well. That led me to
wonder if I can simply use it in conjunction with Fetchmail to do everything
I want at this point, eliminating the need for something like Postfix (which
I've also looked at).

Again, I apologize for what may seem to be extremely basic questions. Would
I generally be correct in conceptualizing as per the following:

1) Fetchmail will pop my mail from my ISP (on behalf of all my accounts) and
interact with an SMTP server to store it centrally on my server;
2) The SMTP server takes care of properly storing the mail, and of sending
SMTP mail back to my ISP; and
3) The IMAP software I choose will allow my Outlook clients to view and
manipulate the mail stored on my server.

If that's generally correct, then I think I'll take advantage of your
helpfulness and veer perhaps wildly off-topic to ask about calendaring,
contacts, and all the other related stuff one normally associates with an
Outlook/Exchange environment. Does any of the software we're discussing
handle these as well, or in my scenario would I still have a PST local to
each client workstation that would store these items, leaving only the mail
on the central server?

&gt;<i> There's no single right answer here.  It all depends on what size of
</I>&gt;<i> installation you've got and what features you want.  You'll find
</I>&gt;<i> people who'll argue strongly for/against particular software because
</I>&gt;<i> of the author, or some historical event relating to the software.  I'd
</I>&gt;<i> recommend you make your own decisions ;)  You may also want to look at
</I>&gt;<i> one of the all-in-one packages that are available to make your life
</I>&gt;<i> easier.
</I>
The installation size is very small - three client workstations with three
e-mail accounts. Not to say it won't get bigger, but only by an account or
two. I'm also interested in the capability to access e-mail via a web
interface, as setting up an OpenVPN installation is somewhere on my to-do
list so that we can get our mail from outside on the Internet if we happen
to be travelling, etc. I had a look at the Wikipedia page on MTAs, which had
a useful MTA comparison; my preference is for an open-source product where
possible but I'm willing to compromise if I need to. What I didn't see was
any package that looked like it included the functionality Fetchmail would
provide based on my understanding of the product.
