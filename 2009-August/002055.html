</I>&gt;<i> subject. The challenge I've encountered is that every page I've come across
</I>&gt;<i> presumes I already have a basic understanding of how e-mail works,
</I>&gt;<i> technically and mechanically, at every stage of the process and how the

</I>&gt;<i> necessarily an accurate assumption. I'm fairly technically adept, but I want
</I>&gt;<i> to make sure I'm starting with a correct conceptual overview so as to
</I>&gt;<i> minimize my own confusion as I walk through the process.
</I>
Then I'd definitely recommend an all-in-one package.

&gt;&gt;<i> 1) What SMTP software you want to use (Sendmail, Postfix, Exim, or others)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So, here's a good example. Do I need to use SMTP software in the first
</I>&gt;<i> place?
</I>
Yes.  That is what fetchmail will hand the mail over to, that's how
you will send outbound email.

&gt;<i> It is my
</I>&gt;<i> understanding that Fetchmail will take care of the pop angle; do I need an
</I>&gt;<i> SMTP server with which Fetchmail will interact, in order to &quot;store&quot; the
</I>&gt;<i> mail, and as well in order to take care of &quot;storing&quot; outbound SMTP mail from
</I>&gt;<i> the mail clients (and, for that matter, sending the outbound SMTP mail to my
</I>&gt;<i> ISP)?
</I>
Note that SMTP is a message *transfer* protocol.  It doesn't store
anything, it just enables you to send (and receive) email.

&gt;&gt;<i> 2) What IMAP/POP software you want to use (UWash, Courier, Cyrus or
</I>&gt;<i> others)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So, because I want to store mail centrally on my server, I presume I will
</I>&gt;<i> need to set up IMAP capability on the server, with which my Outlook mail
</I>&gt;<i> clients will interact to view the mail. I've briefly looked at Courier,
</I>&gt;<i> which also seems to be a fully-fledged SMTP server as well. That led me to
</I>&gt;<i> wonder if I can simply use it in conjunction with Fetchmail to do everything
</I>&gt;<i> I want at this point, eliminating the need for something like Postfix (which
</I>&gt;<i> I've also looked at).
</I>
As long as your chosen setup includes (at least) SMTP and IMAP you can
use whatever software you want ;)

&gt;<i> Again, I apologize for what may seem to be extremely basic questions. Would
</I>&gt;<i> I generally be correct in conceptualizing as per the following:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1) Fetchmail will pop my mail from my ISP (on behalf of all my accounts) and
</I>&gt;<i> interact with an SMTP server to store it centrally on my server;
</I>
Yes

&gt;<i> 2) The SMTP server takes care of properly storing the mail, and of sending
</I>&gt;<i> SMTP mail back to my ISP; and
</I>
No - the IMAP software stores the email.  The SMTP software simply
hands incoming email to it.

&gt;<i> 3) The IMAP software I choose will allow my Outlook clients to view and
</I>&gt;<i> manipulate the mail stored on my server.
</I>
Yes.

&gt;<i> If that's generally correct, then I think I'll take advantage of your
</I>&gt;<i> helpfulness and veer perhaps wildly off-topic to ask about calendaring,
</I>&gt;<i> contacts, and all the other related stuff one normally associates with an
</I>&gt;<i> Outlook/Exchange environment. Does any of the software we're discussing
</I>&gt;<i> handle these as well, or in my scenario would I still have a PST local to
</I>&gt;<i> each client workstation that would store these items, leaving only the mail
</I>&gt;<i> on the central server?
</I>
Take a look at Zimbra, OpenGroupware and others.  Those are the ones
that do calendaring and contacts (well, you can do it yourself with
other software, but it's a lot more work).

&gt;<i> The installation size is very small - three client workstations with three
</I>&gt;<i> e-mail accounts. Not to say it won't get bigger, but only by an account or
</I>&gt;<i> two.
</I>
In that case, it's largely irrelevant what you chose - they'll all cope.

&gt;<i> I'm also interested in the capability to access e-mail via a web
</I>&gt;<i> interface,
</I>
The 2 mail choices, if your package doesn't include it, are
SquirrelMail and Horde.  SquirrelMail is much simpler and more basic,
if you just want a webmail interface then I'd recommend it.

&gt;<i> as setting up an OpenVPN installation is somewhere on my to-do
</I>&gt;<i> list so that we can get our mail from outside on the Internet if we happen
</I>&gt;<i> to be travelling, etc. I had a look at the Wikipedia page on MTAs, which had
</I>&gt;<i> a useful MTA comparison; my preference is for an open-source product where
</I>&gt;<i> possible but I'm willing to compromise if I need to. What I didn't see was
</I>&gt;<i> any package that looked like it included the functionality Fetchmail would
</I>&gt;<i> provide based on my understanding of the product.
</I>
I'll also suggest something bordering on the heritical - Google Apps
;)  You get all the features you've discussed, but don't have to
invest the time and effort into learning how to do it if you don't
want to.  Their standard edition is free and is for up to 50 users.
