<PRE>Greetings,

&gt;<i> I have a problem in which I can't tell if there is a Fetchmail problem  
</I>&gt;<i> or some issue with ssl.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It results in a bunch of email messages I don't want that include the  
</I>&gt;<i> same message:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Server CommonName: *.sslcert35.com.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Is there a way I can stop getting an email every time Fetchmail starts?
</I>&gt;<i> I have enough spam to contend with already.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Because I know it doesn't work.
</I>

As a more verbosely worded answer to the list because my earlier in this  
thread caused irritations (that caused private replies):


We generally have several options to address such problems:


1. (recommended) the user experiencing the problem provides the  
information requested in <A HREF="http://www.fetchmail.info/fetchmail-FAQ.html#G3">http://www.fetchmail.info/fetchmail-FAQ.html#G3</A> .

If corporate policies or privacy concerns do not permit sending the debug  
information to the list, send a public problem report with the unsensitive  
data, and then a separate message with the sensitive information directly  
to me (i. e. off list), please use a related subject, for instance, in  
private, you'd write &quot;Log/Conf for fetchmail-users Server CommonName  
sslcert35.com issue&quot; in this case. For confidential data, you can also  
send GnuPG encrypted mail, please use my key 0x052e7d95.


2. (discouraged) fix the symptoms and move on. For cronjobs, I would  
suggest something similar to the following, which filters this particular  
annoying line from fetchmail's output. (Running as a root user to redirect  
cron mail is not a good idea.)

3,33 * * * * fetchmail | egrep -v '^Server CommonName: \*\.sslcert35\.com'
(this runs every x:03 and x:33 minutes 24 x 7)

3. (bad luck) If you cannot disclose server names and IP addresses at all,  
then I fear I cannot help you with issues related to DNS, SSL and TLS, and  
possibly also multidrop. It's often that I cannot reproduce the problem  
with the configuration that is shown if information partially masked, and  
a similar problem isn't sufficient to reproduce the problem; and  
particularly with SSL and TLS, I often need to talk to the same server as  
your copy of fetchmail would do for you.


I presumed James was in a &quot;cannot provide information&quot; like situation so  
suggested to fix the symptom (I advise against running as root though).


This isn't to erect artificial obstacles for support from my side, but my  
time to support fetchmail generally is limited and shared with code  
writing and other open source projects, so please bear with me if my  
utterings are too terse (OTOH, terse usually means I have taken time to  
reply earlier than I would have been able to for a long reply), and please  
help me help you by not hiding essential information such as your server's  
DNS name. (I don't usually need your username - your local site admin  
might need that though, and I never need your password.)
We may sometimes need - particularly for SSL/TLS issues - the assistance  
of the admin of the server you're fetching from, too.

Note also that I continually try to improve documentation to make sure it  
answers questions that arise over time, and the most current versions of  
6.3.X documentation are currently available by peeking at the SVN  
repository, <A HREF="http://mknod.org/svn/fetchmail/branches/BRANCH_6-3">http://mknod.org/svn/fetchmail/branches/BRANCH_6-3</A> (check  
README.SSL for instance) - courteously hosted by Graham Wilson, a former  
fetchmail maintainer - my repeated thanks for this service.  The  
documentation usually mentions when a feature was introduced or change, so  
even if you're using an older version of fetchmail that your distributor  
fixed WRT security holes, reading the most current manpage may be useful.


I hope this clarifies irritations that may have arisen of my earlier  
perhaps harsh-sounding reply.

Sorry for that.


I am interested in problem reports, but I need a complete picture and a  
may need your further availability for further questions.

Best regards and happy fetching
Matthias
