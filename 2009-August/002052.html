Sort of.  Fetchmail allows you to retrieve email from your ISP (and
any other POP/IMAP servers) and pass it to your local SMTP server.  It
is up to your SMTP server what happens next.

&gt;<i> With that as a summary of what I'd like to do, I would be very grateful if

There is no shortage of information out there on this subject.  Throw
appropriate words into any search engine and you'll get a host of
pages taking you through the process.  You'll need to make 2
decisions:

1) What SMTP software you want to use (Sendmail, Postfix, Exim, or others)
2) What IMAP/POP software you want to use (UWash, Courier, Cyrus or others)

There's no single right answer here.  It all depends on what size of
installation you've got and what features you want.  You'll find
people who'll argue strongly for/against particular software because
of the author, or some historical event relating to the software.  I'd
recommend you make your own decisions ;)  You may also want to look at
one of the all-in-one packages that are available to make your life
easier.

There's nothing particularly difficult about what you're planning -
it's the setup I've got myself.
