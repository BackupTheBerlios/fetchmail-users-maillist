</I>  	&lt;G&gt;  Thanks.  I believe however that mailman sends
	only one copy, since I'm on the List.  That has been
	true of mailman for quite a while, I believe.  Let
	us know if you receive two copies of this reply.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 	 being inspected gets moved to cur/.  This is somehow
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 	 reminiscent of qmail, which I ran for a while a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 	 few years ago, but abandoned for the &quot;usual reasons&quot;&lt;g&gt;.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Hi Alan,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> indeed Dan J. Bernstein's qmail pioneered that &quot;Maildir&quot; format, which
</I>&gt;<i> got later extended (I think it was Sam Varshavchik/Inter 7's Courier
</I>&gt;<i> package) to Maildir++ with quota support.
</I>  	 I am sure that you are right.  I have done further research,
	 and experimentation, and the system I'm trying to read from
	 is indeed a Maildir system.

&gt;<i> &gt;       It is possible that dovecot is installed on the upstream
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;       computer I am fetching mail from.  There is, clearly, a 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;       lot about this situation that I don't understand!
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> There is a certain choice of software (and surely not just a tiny one on
</I>&gt;<i> Debian) that allows access. Dovecot is a (somewhat) younger software
</I>&gt;<i> that is popular because it's easy to configure and very efficient CPU
</I>&gt;<i> and I/O-wise, especially for an IMAP server.
</I>         I believe that the system I'm grabbing from( Globaltap.com,
	 a web hosting company based in Baltimore ) does indeed use
	 dovecot.  Globaltap is run by two friends of mine whose main
	 focus up to now has been on Web hosting.  They've yielded to
	 my pleadings and set up a shell account for me, for which I'll
	 pay them.

&gt;<i> I suppose a &quot;big picture&quot; and glossary of typical fetchmail uses to
</I>&gt;<i> accompany the documentation might help.  I'll add one, time permitting.
</I>         I would be interested, at such time as you do it.  I'm
	 sure others would be too.  I think it is a hard job though.
	 What a host of complications has grown up around something originally
	 so simple as the SMTP dialog!

	 My goal however is more than to grab mail from Globaltap; 
	 I think that my fetchmail setup now does that fine.  What
	 I will now work on is using Globaltap as a &quot;smart host&quot;
	 (Wietse Venema uses the term &quot;relay host&quot;).  I want to 
	 use my own   mutt   on my home machine, my own   postfix  ,
	 configured to pass what I write on to globaltap which
	 will then pass it on to the world as coming from
	      <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/fetchmail-users">alan at globaltap.com</A>  .

	 So I shall now proceed on to this more difficult task.
	 I thank all fetchmail-users responders for their
	 comments and insights.

Best wishes,

Alan
