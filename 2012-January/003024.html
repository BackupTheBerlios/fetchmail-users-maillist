</I>    	 I now have further information about this. The

	 few years ago, but abandoned for the &quot;usual reasons&quot;&lt;g&gt;.

&gt;<i> &gt; So my question: how to make a .fetchmailrc that will
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; pull the single files from ~/mail/new/?  the files

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Running 'file' on them tells me that they are &quot;ASCII mail
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; text&quot;, and I can inspect their contents.
</I>    	   I made a fairly standard .fetchmailrc which, now,
	   seems to do the trick.  See below.

&gt;<i> you must be thinking of a different tool than the fetchmail that is
</I>&gt;<i> discussed on this list. 
</I>  	  &lt;G&gt;

&gt;<i> &quot;My&quot; fetchmail does not support reading from traditional mail
</I>&gt;<i> spools, unless you add a separate software that exports the
</I>&gt;<i> mail spool through IMAP, such as UW's imapd.  Fetchmail does
</I>&gt;<i> not do that by itself, neither for /var/mail/USER or
</I>&gt;<i> /var/spool/mail/USER, nor for $HOME/mail/new/.
</I>  	Hard to say what &quot;your&quot; fetchmail does, or supports.
	As just stated, &quot;my&quot; fetchmail, which is
	6.3.18+GSS+NTLM+SDPS+SSL+NLS+KRB5(installed when I
	moved from Debian etch to Debian squeeze) seems to
	grab the mail from ~/mail/cur/, on the system I am
	accessing.  I can give you the relevant 'poll' and
	'user' lines from my .fetchmailrc if you are curious.

&gt;<i> storage format is Maildir (i. e. there are cur and tmp directories under
</I>&gt;<i> ~/mail), or traditional /var(/spool)/mail, I recommend installing
</I>&gt;<i> Dovecot on the computer that needs to export the mail, and only then can
</I>&gt;<i> you use fetchmail on the computer that needs to download the mail.
</I>      It is possible that dovecot is installed on the upstream
      computer I am fetching mail from.  There is, clearly, a 
      lot about this situation that I don't understand!

&gt;<i> I hope that helps.
</I>      &lt;G&gt; It was certainly a suggestive post.  And I thank you for
      taking the time to write it.  Are there others on this
      discussion E-list?

Herzliche Gr&#252;sse!
