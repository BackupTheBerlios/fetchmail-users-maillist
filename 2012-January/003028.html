Hi Alan,

indeed Dan J. Bernstein's qmail pioneered that &quot;Maildir&quot; format, which
got later extended (I think it was Sam Varshavchik/Inter 7's Courier
package) to Maildir++ with quota support.

&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;My&quot; fetchmail does not support reading from traditional mail

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> mail spool through IMAP, such as UW's imapd.  Fetchmail does
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> not do that by itself, neither for /var/mail/USER or
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> /var/spool/mail/USER, nor for $HOME/mail/new/.
</I>
&gt;<i>   	Hard to say what &quot;your&quot; fetchmail does, or supports.
</I>
Well, I know what it can and cannot do, left to its own devices. :)

&gt;<i> 	As just stated, &quot;my&quot; fetchmail, which is
</I>&gt;<i> 	6.3.18+GSS+NTLM+SDPS+SSL+NLS+KRB5(installed when I
</I>&gt;<i> 	moved from Debian etch to Debian squeeze) seems to
</I>&gt;<i> 	grab the mail from ~/mail/cur/, on the system I am
</I>&gt;<i> 	accessing.  I can give you the relevant 'poll' and
</I>&gt;<i> 	'user' lines from my .fetchmailrc if you are curious.
</I>
As I said, fetchmail alone cannot access such directories (nor mbox) to
fetch mail from - there must be some other software installed on the
computer that you poll from that offers POP3 and/or IMAP access to those
directories so that fetchmail can contact that software and download
your mail.  Which software that is is sometimes visible in the logged
greeting banners that get displayed when you run fetchmail with  -vv added.

&gt;&gt;<i> storage format is Maildir (i. e. there are cur and tmp directories under
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ~/mail), or traditional /var(/spool)/mail, I recommend installing
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Dovecot on the computer that needs to export the mail, and only then can
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> you use fetchmail on the computer that needs to download the mail.
</I>
&gt;<i>       It is possible that dovecot is installed on the upstream
</I>&gt;<i>       computer I am fetching mail from.  There is, clearly, a 
</I>&gt;<i>       lot about this situation that I don't understand!
</I>
There is a certain choice of software (and surely not just a tiny one on
Debian) that allows access. Dovecot is a (somewhat) younger software
that is popular because it's easy to configure and very efficient CPU
and I/O-wise, especially for an IMAP server.

I suppose a &quot;big picture&quot; and glossary of typical fetchmail uses to
accompany the documentation might help.  I'll add one, time permitting.

&gt;<i>       &lt;G&gt; It was certainly a suggestive post.  And I thank you for
</I>&gt;<i>       taking the time to write it.  Are there others on this
</I>&gt;<i>       discussion E-list?
</I>
Most certainly - last time I checked it had a few hundred subscribers,
most of whom just read and never post -- which is fine.

If you're curious, the archives of the list are online at
<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/pipermail/fetchmail-users/">https://lists.berlios.de/pipermail/fetchmail-users/</A> and will give you a
hint as to who writes regularly here. :)

Best regards
Matthias
