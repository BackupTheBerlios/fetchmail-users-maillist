</I>No. I'd say the correct question would be: why not take a chance?
In case that the next hop really cannot cope with the broken mail
it will drop it itself or bounce it or something like that.
But in the other case the mail will reach its recipient.
I am sure you will agree that not 100% fall into the first category
and therefore fetchmail should TRY to deliver it to the next hop
instead of deliberately deleting it.

In my case the invalid header was this line:
&quot;This is a multi-part message in MIME format.&quot;
The mail program of the sender just forgot to put an empty line before
this line.  Really bad but NOT a reason to delete the otherwise
good mail.  If fetchmail deletes it because the RFCs say that such
a mail is invalid, fetchmail also has to comply with the part of the
RFCs that (I am pretty sure that) say that a mail should never be
dropped without at least notifying someone.

&gt;<i> Leaving it on the server doesn't help either except for clogging up
</I>&gt;<i> the inbox with more and more unfetchable messages over time, the
</I>&gt;<i> invalid headers won't magically cure themselves.
</I>Okay, I agree.  So the only solution is to try to pass it on to the
next hop.

&gt;<i> I wonder how much of the dumped mail is actually legitimate and how
</I>&gt;<i> much stems from broken spam engines.
</I>No spam, these mails are definitely HAMs (newsletter of the German
food chain Penny).  I already wrote them about their misconfiguration.

 Every once in a while, declare peace. It confuses the heck out of your enemies.
