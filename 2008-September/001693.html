Well - basically what the source comment (I just checked) states is that
fetchmail would otherwise segfault.

This is code I inherited. I'd tend to say if the major rationale is
to mask other errors (segfault) later down the code path, we'd better be
fixing them instead - what should have happened in the first place.

Apparently people such as Fr&#233;d&#233;ric Marchal and distros have had some
success with just having fetchmail pass on the garbage and let the next
hop deal with it: fetchmail doesn't crash. So chances are the segfault
suggested in the source code has been dealt with long ago, but the
segfault not retested, whatever.

Still I'm not comfortable with just tossing garbage down the
MTA/MDA/LMTP listener...

We might consider such a line &quot;end-of-header&quot; and pretend we'd seen the
blank line - but that, as well as &quot;send as message/rfc822 attachment&quot;
(as discussed previously, and which has shortcomings on its own,
particularly with multidrop), is a major change.

Yet another (and simple to attain) solution would be to not forward and
not delete the message, which OTOH means it will stick on the server
forever.

Depending on whom you ask, there are various opinions on how to deal
with that, so maybe we should start with a switch that says
&quot;brokenheader = { skip_message, pass_message, prepend_blank_line }&quot; with perhaps a
later extension of a fourth &quot;attach_instead&quot; state.

The default would clearly be refuse in 6.3.10+ (I don't think I'll add
this option to 6.3.9) for compatibility, some distros would patch it to
default to try_pass (which is what Fr&#233;d&#233;ric's and other patches already
do), and I'm not sure if a &quot;bounce_message&quot; would work.

NB: &quot;bouncing&quot; doesn't work with MDA... (except if it has, as sendmail
and perhaps exim, a -oem delivery mode or operates in a manner that it
will guarantee someone gets either the message or a notification).

&gt;<i> In case that the next hop really cannot cope with the broken mail
</I>&gt;<i> it will drop it itself or bounce it or something like that.
</I>&gt;<i> But in the other case the mail will reach its recipient.
</I>&gt;<i> I am sure you will agree that not 100% fall into the first category
</I>&gt;<i> and therefore fetchmail should TRY to deliver it to the next hop
</I>&gt;<i> instead of deliberately deleting it.
</I>
It's subtler: fetchmail considers this broken message &quot;refused&quot;
(PS_REFUSED as internal state) and suppresses forwarding, but not
deleting.  When run with --keep, the message remains on the server.

Yes I know the situation is unsatisfactory, but lack of time for doing
it right and all that...
