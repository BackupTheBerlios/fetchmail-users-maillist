<PRE>Greetings,

I am announcing the release of fetchmail 6.3.9. This new stable version
of fetchmail fixes two security and two critical bugs since the previous
version, and makes various other changes, see below for details.

The software is available from:
&lt;<A HREF="http://developer.berlios.de/project/showfiles.php?group_id=1824">http://developer.berlios.de/project/showfiles.php?group_id=1824</A>&gt;

The fetchmail home pages are:
&lt;<A HREF="http://www.fetchmail.info/">http://www.fetchmail.info/</A>&gt;  or  &lt;<A HREF="http://fetchmail.berlios.de/">http://fetchmail.berlios.de/</A>&gt;

These are the relevant changes in 6.3.9 since 6.3.8;
unless otherwise noted, changes to this release were made by Matthias Andree:

# ADVANCE WARNING OF FEATURES TO BE REMOVED OR CHANGED IN FUTURE VERSIONS
(There are no plans to remove these features from a 6.3.X release, but they may
be removed from a 6.4.0 or newer release.)
* The MX and host alias DNS lookups that fetchmail performs in multidrop mode
  are based on assumptions that are rarely met in practice, somewhat defective,
  deprecated and may be removed from a future fetchmail version.  They have
  never supported IPv6 (including IPv6-mapped IPv4).
  Non-DNS based alias keywords such as &quot;aka&quot; will remain in fetchmail.
* The monitor and interface options may be removed from a future fetchmail
  version as they are not reasonably portable.
* POP2 is obsolete, support will be removed from a future fetchmail version.
* RPOP is obsolete, support will be removed from a future fetchmail release.
* --sslcertck will become a default setting in a future fetchmail version.
* The multidrop To/Cc guessing code along with the fragile duplicate suppressor
  is deprecated and may be removed from a future release.
* The &quot;envelope Received&quot; option may be removed from a future release, because
  the Received header was never meant to be machine-readable, the format varies
  widely, and various other differences in behavior make parsing Received an
  unreliable undertaking. The envelope option as such will remain though, in
  order to support Delivered-To, X-Envelope-To, X-Original-To and similar.
  See also &lt;<A HREF="http://home.pages.de/~mandree/mail/multidrop">http://home.pages.de/~mandree/mail/multidrop</A>&gt;.
* The --enable-fallback (fall back to MDA if MTA unavailable) will be removed
  from a future fetchmail release, because it makes fetchmail's behavior
  inconsistent and confusing.
* The &quot;protocol auto&quot; default inside fetchmail may be removed from a future
  fetchmail release. Explicit configuration of the protocol is recommended.
* Kerberos IV support may be removed from a future fetchmail release.
* SIGHUP wakeup support may be removed from a future fetchmail release and
  cause fetchmail to terminate - it was broken for many years.
* Support for operating systems that are not sufficiently POSIX compliant may be
  removed or operation on such systems may be suboptimal for future releases.

# SECURITY AND CRITICAL BUG FIXES:
* CVE-2007-4565: Denial of service: When fetchmail tries to inject a warning
  message it created itself, and the message is refused by the SMTP listener,
  fetchmail dereferences a NULL pointer and crashes. Report &amp; fix by Earl Chew.
  Note while this is theoretically a remote denial of service attack vector,
  fetchmail by default talks SMTP to the localhost, so the overall risk is
  rather low.
  This bug was apparently introduced on 1998-11-27 when the bouncemail facility
  was modularized. The bug then made its appearance in fetchmail release 4.6.8.
  See also fetchmail-SA-2007-02.txt.
* CVE-2008-2711: Denial of service: When fetchmail logs data blobs
  (for instance, a To: header in -v -v verbose mode) in excess of 2048
  bytes, it will crash, because it hands an uninitialized argument
  pointer (not the format string though) to vsnprintf and reads a
  random memory location (it calls va_arg() too often without
  resetting it with va_start()). Based on a patch (BerliOS patch #2492)
  by Petr Uzel, fixes Novell Bug #354291.
  Note 6.3.9-rc1 did not completely fix this issue, so it was redrawn a few 
  hours after its release.
  See also fetchmail-SA-2008-01.txt.
* When expunging, mark the right messages as seen to avoid message loss in &quot;keep
  flush&quot; configurations.  Workaround for previous versions: &quot;expunge 0&quot;.
  Report and patch by Alexander Cherepanov - thanks a lot, Berlios Bug #11797,
  &quot;imap_mark_seen doesn't consider expunged messages&quot;.
* SSL fix: close memory leak when SSL connection fails; fetchmail used to forget
  calling SSL_free() on the SSL context, leaking in excess of 500 kB RAM on a
  x86_64 system per failed SSL connection attempt.
  Bug reported and patch provided by Seiichi Ikarashi, Fujitsu.

# BUG FIXES:
* The configure script will additionally check for 'dn_skipname', to fix build
  failures with &#181;Clibc. The new check still recognizes the resolver libraries on
  Ubuntu 7.04, openSUSE 10.2, Solaris 8, NetBSD 4.0_BETA2 and FreeBSD 6.2.
  Fixes Gentoo bug #134187.
  NOTE: this is a bit of a hack, since we twist the HAVE_RES_SEARCH result, but
  res_search() and dn_skipname() are only used together and scheduled for
  removal in future versions, so this is probably fine.
* No longer complain about invalid sslproto &quot;&quot; when POP3 CAPA probe fails.
  Fixes Debian Bug#421446 (Holger Leskien), Novell Bug #247233 (Jon Nelson).
  Thanks to Matthias Strau&#223; for a configuration to reproduce the issue.
* Allow .fetchmailrc and .fetchids to be symlinks, as the manpage does not
  document they aren't allowed - fixes Debian Bug #452907 (Roger Leigh).
  TOCTOU race persists.
* fetchmailconf quotes mailbox (folder) names when writing the configuration.
  Fixes BerliOS Bug #13207 (reported + fix suggested by Terry Brown).
* Only print &quot;Deleting fetchids file&quot; if there actually is one.
  Fixes Debian Bug#374514, reported by Dan Jacobson.
* SSL fix: check and report if SSL_set_fd fails.

# CHANGES:
* autoconf 2.60 is now required to build fetchmail; it uses
  AC_USE_SYSTEM_EXTENSIONS to replace AC_AIX, AC_MINIX, and the like.
* Removed dead FETCHMAIL_DEBUG code from fetchmail.h that was disabled by 
  default with no switches in configure to enable it. However, the macro would 
  have been prone to a symlink attack. Found by Nico Golde.
* Removed dead FORCE_STUFFING code from socket.c that was disabled by default
  with no switches in configure to enable it.
* Include the typedef for int16 in the #ifndef _AIX in smbencrypt.c (Peter
  O'Gorman)
* Correct check for u_int32_t in configure.ac (seems to be typedef'ed in
  namser.h on some platforms.) (Peter O'Gorman)
* In configure.ac change all CPFLAGS to CPPFLAGS, CEFLAGS to CFLAGS and LDEFLAGS
  to LDFLAGS otherwise the results of some tests (additional -L and -I flags) do
  not get used for later tests causing incorrect configure results. Makefile.am
  was also changed to reflect this. (Peter O'Gorman)
* m4/gethostbyname_r.m4 does AC_TRY_COMPILE, which unfortunately can pass even
  if there is no gethostbyname_r. Changed to AC_TRY_LINK. (Peter O'Gorman)
* Revise getnameinfo check to ensure NULL is defined and the result is properly
  evaluated, to avoid bogus results on for instance FreeBSD and redefinitions of
  NI_* at compile time. (Matthias Andree).
* __attribute__ ((unused)) is a gccism, removed from libesmtp/gethostbyname.c.
  (Peter O'Gorman)
* In KAME/getnameinfo.c it's best to use the correct argument to inet_ntoa.
  (Peter O'Gorman)
* In verbose mode, log if --check mode is enabled.
* Add sslcommonname option (rcfile and commandline) as a way to work around
  misconfigured upstream SSL servers that use the wrong certificate name. It
  specifies which CommonName fetchmail expects and logs. (Daniel Richard G.)
* Changed CRLF to LF line endings in contrib/delete-later (reporter: Petr Uzel)
* SSL change: enable all workarounds with SSL_CTX_set_options(ctx,SSL_OP_ALL)
* All translations have been re-enabled, in an attempt to rekindle translator or
  user interest.

# DOCUMENTATION:
* Add fetchmail-SA-2007-02.txt and fetchmail-SA-2008-01.txt.
* Re-add two lines to the manual page that had accidentally become comments 
  to nroff. One was part of the --sslproto documentation, and one in the 
  &quot;Awakening the background daemon&quot; section.
* The manual page no longer asserts that .fetchids were for exclusive POP3 use, 
  since it is planned to use the file with IMAP4 later.
* Add grammar fixes from Dan Jacobson to fetchmail.man. Debian Bug #461642.
* The manual page now mentions that user descriptions need to come before user
  options. Reported by Francensco Pontort&#236;, to fix Debian Bug #467010.
* The manual page no longer hints that multi-user declarations per server were
  only useful in daemon mode running as root, to avoid hinting people to doing
  that.
* Several manual page rcfile examples now include &quot;ssl&quot;.
* The manual page hints that option arguments beginning with numbers can be
  enclosed in quotes.
* The manual page now mentions that the --logfile must already exist before
  fetchmail is run.
* The FAQ now recommends (#I9) not to use Google Mail for their disregard to the
  protocols they claim to support.
* Documentation and program output now /consistently/ claim that the rcfile must
  not have more than 0700 (u=rwx,g=,o=) permissions, but fetchmail will still
  silently accept additional g=x permissions for compatibility with previous
  6.2.X and 6.3.X versions.
  Inconsistency (program 0710, manpage 0600) reported by Petr Uzel.
* The --logfile documentation is now clearer about requiring detached daemon 
  mode.
