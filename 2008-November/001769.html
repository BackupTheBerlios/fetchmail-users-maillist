Please keep list traffic on the list, using &quot;group reply&quot;, &quot;list reply&quot; or
similar. I've taken the liberty of redirecting things to the list.

&gt;<i> Yes, but, but . . .  I did download and compile 6.3.8 from &quot;your place&quot;,
</I>&gt;<i> in an earlier go round of issues and for security concerns.   Novell,
</I>&gt;<i> last I tried, cared not to deal with the later versions of fetchmail.
</I>
Hum, I've seen Novell OES fetchmail security updates. If they haven't fixed
CVE-2008-2711 or CVE-2007-4565 yet, you might want to send a gentle request
to include those, and perhaps the two critical fixes from 6.3.9, in an
update. There were not too intrusive and the SVN repo where they can pull
from is freely accessible.

Having said that, 6.3.8 is - for the nonce - recent enough to qualify for
support on this list until I request that you try 6.3.9.

BTW, have you seen the FAQ? Particularly question and answer G3 are relevant:

<A HREF="http://www.fetchmail.info/fetchmail-FAQ.html#G3">http://www.fetchmail.info/fetchmail-FAQ.html#G3</A>

&gt;<i> So, in their view, there is no support.   Last I checked.
</I>
I'm not a Novell customer, so I don't care. The alternative is going with
the latest version(s) that are supported on the list, these today are
6.3.9, and 6.3.8 to some extent.

I for one don't have the resources to keep a zoo of old distributions
around; I rather have to see to replacing my development computer in the
not too distant future. /Usually/ distributions aren't the culprit if you
compile a recent version of fetchmail yourself. The quick starting point,
barring special requirements is the usual &quot;./configure --with-ssl &amp;&amp; make&quot;
as unprivileged user and then &quot;make install&quot; as super user.

&gt;<i> There are two things I am going to try.  The fetchmail I use at &quot;my
</I>&gt;<i> place&quot; is an identical setup, save only the destination host and user
</I>&gt;<i> names.   Will try to &quot;overload&quot; here.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Will try the command line switches you suggested at the problem site.
</I>
Do check the mail and system logs at the problem site, /var/log/messages,
/var/log/mail*, perhaps /var/log/warn for a quick glance. If there are any
SMTP/bind/DNS/resolv/sendmail/postfix deferrals, errors, warnings - these
are the ones to deal with first.
