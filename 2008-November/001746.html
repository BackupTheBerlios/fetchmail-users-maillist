<PRE>Hi fetchmail list,
 
we&#180;re using fetchmail for smaller servers to pull mails from the pop
servers to their mailboxes, mostly when we don&#180;t have control over the
MX settings.
To keep their mailboxes small and prevent the users for missusing e-mail
for data transfers with large files we limit the local MTA to e.g. 10
MB.
Often the MX allows bigger messages. So if there are bigger messages we
delete them with the --limitflush option, user gets a notification that
a oversized message has been deleted.
Everything fine until now.
 
The Problem is: The user has no clue who was the original sender and the
sender does not get any error message.
So user knows there was a big message and it has been deleted and sender
thinks user received the message, there is a lack of information.
 
Two possible solutions by design I can think about:
 
1. Sender is notified that the message is oversized, was rejected by the
MTA and has been deleted.
Something like: MTA said 5XX (permanent error), given up, your message
was deleted and not deliverd, maybe quote the MTA, we should do this for
all 5XX errors.
or 
2.User notification is with headers of the original mail.
Something like:
The messsage received on 01.01.2008 8:00 am was rejected by MTA due
error 5XX and deleted. Please ask the sender to correct the error and
resend the mails.
Headers following.
 
We could bring this feature request futher not only to --limitflush but
to any 5XX errors or even to to 4XX error as we often have the situation
that the MX do not very intensive checking when receiving the mails but
we want to do at our MX before delivering to the users.
Shure we could make the local MTA more weak but we even have mixed
configurations like MTA is MX for domain test.com and otherwise
fetchmail polls mails from testxyz.com as we don&#180;t have the control over
DNS.
 
So, whats everbody thinking about this.
 
Bye Bernhard Boxhorn
