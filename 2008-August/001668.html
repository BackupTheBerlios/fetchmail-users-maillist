There's an SSL connection, negotiation and stuff like that take place where
it hangs. Possible reasons why it's slow (not exhaustive):

- network is slow and/or loses packets, or has high latency

- your computer has /dev/random and too little entropy in the pool.
What OS and version, what processor and speed, what kind of computer?
Desktop? Laptop? Architecture? What else is it used for? Anything that
might drain entropy quickly? Sorry if I missed this in earlier messages.

Attaching strace, truss, sotruss, ltrace or similar to fetchmail,
displaying timestamps or better time differencing might hinting where it
waits. Be sure to look for passwords and blank them before showing logs.

- SSL does some network lookups (DNS, cert revocations, whatever) under the
hood that take a long time.  tracers as named in the previous paragraph
might reveal what's going on, or interspersed HTTP/UDP logs might. Not sure
that it's the case. Let's check logs, for that matter, omit the &quot;tcp&quot;
filter from the tcpdump command line.

Just bzip2 your resulting tcpdump -w foo file and mail it to me off-list.
Note it may contain cleartext passwords if not everything contained in the
dump was encrypted through SSL/TLS - double check whom you're sending it to.

- your computer is slow so that number crunching done as part of SSL takes
a long time - rather not, given the user/sys figures you quoted. This might
rather bite older 386 and 486 computers, and perhaps older SPARCs as of 15
years ago...

Here, fetchmail has just opened the SMTP connection to your local SMTP
server - what kind of spam filtering and DNS lookups does it do?

This might be a DNS configuration issue or problem with the resolver. Can
you show host.conf and resolv.conf and annotate IPs you find and check the
computers mentioned for DNS-related logs?

Do the Speedport's logs show DNS-related entries?

Do you use DHCP on the computer running fetchmail?

I'd rather have the raw dump (the file you get from tcpdump -w) if you
don't mind, otherwise just the tcpdump output.

Send off-list, you can use GnuPG key 0x052e7d95 to encrypt if unsure about
information contained. I'll treat that confidentially, but note again it
may contain passwords (particularly the raw dump) if they appear in the
captured part of the packets -- so if you don't trust me, we'll have to
find another way of figuring what happens.
