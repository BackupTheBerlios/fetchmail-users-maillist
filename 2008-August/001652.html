<PRE>Hello Matthias,

[ omitting leafnode-list to reduce my embarrassing spam ]

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I changed my internet access at home from dsl to vdsl, and am now
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> connected via a router (Speedport W 701v). Everything works fine
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> except fetchmail and fetchnews -- they just hang. Even smtp (via
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> msmtp) works, also ssh, jabber, irc (both also via ssl) etc.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What do you see in tcpdump or tshark for the respective connection while
</I>&gt;<i> it's still live?
</I>
Will try that once I'm back home and come back with it tomorrow.

&gt;<i> Any tools or web pages of the Speedport WRT link/line quality or any
</I>&gt;<i> suspect logging in the Speedport's web interface?
</I>
As mentioned above, everything works except fetchmail &amp;
fetchnews. Nothing in Speedport's logs.

&gt;<i> Does your Speedport have current firmware?
</I>
Yes.

&gt;<i> Does your Apple have current kernel + network utilities?
</I>
Yes.

&gt;<i> Do you have some sort of firewall on the local (Apple) computer?
</I>
No.

&gt;<i> Do things start to work if you set your MTU of the computer's interface
</I>&gt;<i> leading to the router to, say, 1400? (Not sure what overhead VDSL
</I>&gt;<i> entails, if it's different from regular PPP over DSL.)
</I>
I'll try when I'm back home, and come back. Right now, at a
friend's house I'm using pppoe over dsl and:

$ ifconfig en1
en1: flags=8863&lt;UP,BROADCAST,SMART,RUNNING,SIMPLEX,MULTICAST&gt; mtu 1500
	inet6 fe80::211:24ff:fe21:a1f3%en1 prefixlen 64 scopeid 0x5 
	inet 10.0.1.3 netmask 0xffffff00 broadcast 10.0.1.255
	ether 00:11:24:21:a1:f3 
	media: autoselect status: active
	supported media: autoselect
 
&gt;&gt;<i> As my provider is not exactly helpful to say the least, I am
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Are they still shuffling calls for the same case between different call
</I>&gt;<i> centers with &quot;I have do call XYZ to ask...&quot; sort of replies as they used
</I>&gt;<i> to a year ago?
</I>
After 2 days on several hotlines with torture chamber muzak and
people trying to explain to me how to configure Outlook (or
online support chat: Bitte wenden Sie sich an den
Softwarehersteller etc. etc.) this morning I actually got someone
who didn't treat me like a complete freak and supposedly passes
the issue on to someone who knows about unix, linux. Perhaps this
person will even know what fetchmail is. Usenet of course draws a
complete blank ... right, I stop here.

&gt;&gt;<i> The most annoying thing is that AppleMail *is* able to retrieve
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> mail from all accounts; which led the hotline to say: well, use
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the standard mail program then ... of course there isn't any
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;standard program&quot; to fetch news etc. etc. I refrain from
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ranting. This guy also said that this works for him with Linux,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that it must be a Mac-Problem. But what kind of Mac-Problem?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Nobody has any idea.
</I>
That was quite a few hotmail calls ago, and I seriously doubt
that the guy actually runs Linux or fetchmail for that matter, as
he only said this /after/ it worked with AppleMail.

&gt;<i> Broken Path MTU discovery through improper ICMP or TCP/IP flag filtering
</I>&gt;<i> is a more common problem, but...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Here's also a log of an attempt that hung a tiny bit later in 1
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> instance (passwords provided by .netrc):
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> fetchmail: 6.3.9-rc2 querying milestone.prossl.de (protocol IMAP) at Sun, 03 Aug 2008 12:06:23 +0200 (CEST): poll started
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> fetchmail: timeout after 60 seconds waiting to connect to server milestone.prossl.de.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> fetchmail: socket error while fetching from ***@milestone.prossl.de
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> ...the fragments used to connect are not large enough to trigger path
</I>&gt;<i> MTU problems.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> $ leafnode-version
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> version: leafnode-2.0.0.alpha20080624a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> current machine: Darwin krille.blacktrash.org 8.11.0 Darwin Kernel Version 8.11.0: Wed Oct 10 18:26:00 PDT 2007; root:xnu-792.24.17~1/RELEASE_PPC Power Macintosh powerpc
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Hm. No fetchnews log provided - but I'm not sure if that would be
</I>&gt;<i> any different from fetchmail's log (something like &quot;server went away
</I>&gt;<i> while ...&quot; is likely).
</I>
Yeah, that's why I didn't bother yet. My guess is that once (if
ever) I've got fetchmail working again fetchnews will work too.

&gt;<i> HTH
</I> 
I'm already pleased when I'm not treated like a complete idiot ;)
Thanks very much for taking time to look into this.
