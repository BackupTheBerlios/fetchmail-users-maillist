<PRE>I am still having problems with fetchmail and my 3 mail servers.  I  
have read the Retrieval Failure Modes section of the fetchmail man  
page, but I still cannot solve my problem.  I was able to use nmap to  
determine that the servers I am polling are all pop3, so the issues  
with pop2 listed in that section of the man page are not relevant.

For the 2 servers that give me trouble, nmap says they are pop3, but  
cannot determine the server info from the fingerprint.  For the  
server that works correctly, nmap says it is pop3d (notice the 'd')  
and that it is a Novell Groupwise server.

Do you have any other advice for using nmap to troubleshoot this?

Any other suggestions?

Below is my original message describing the problem.  In short, I  
receive all mail from the the 2 problematic servers every time I poll  
them.  I only want to receive unread mail.

--------

I have my .fetchmailrc set to poll 3 mail servers (like below but  
without the specific servers, usernames, and passwords).  As you can  
see I have all three servers set up the same way.  However, both  
servers 1 and 3 always download all my mail whether it was read  
previously or not.  server2 skips downloading previously read  
messages and only downloads mail that is new since the last fetch.   
Because I have the three set up the same here in my .fetchmailrc,  
there must be something specific to the servers that causes this  
behavior.

1) How can I figure out the nature of the servers on the other end? And,

2) What can I do in my .fetchmailrc file to make fetchmail skip  
downloading previously read messages for all servers?

I check my mail from a number of computers, and I want all my mail to  
be available to all the computers, but have each computer only  
download the mail that is new for that particular computer (but which  
I may have read on another one already)

Thanks in advance,
isen
